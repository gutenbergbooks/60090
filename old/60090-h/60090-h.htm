<p class="ph1">The Dim Lantern</p>



<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />

<small>IN WHICH PHILOMEL SINGS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Sherwood Park</span> is twelve miles from Washington.
Starting as a somewhat pretentious suburb
on the main line of a railroad, it was blessed with
easy accessibility until encroaching trolleys swept
the tide of settlement away from it, and left it high
and dry&mdash;its train service, unable to compete with
modern motor vehicles, increasingly inefficient.</p>

<p>Property values, inevitably, decreased. The little
suburb degenerated, grew less fashionable.
People who might have added social luster to its
gatherings moved away. The frame houses, which
at first had made such a brave showing, became a
bit down at the heel. Most of them, built before
the revival of good taste in architecture, seemed
top-heavy and dull with their imitation towers,
their fretted balconies, their gray and brown coloring,
their bands of contrasting shingles tied like
sashes around their middles.</p>

<p>The Barnes cottage was saved from the universal
lack of loveliness by its simple lines, its white paint
and green blinds. Yet the paint had peeled in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
places, and the concrete steps which followed the
line of the two terraces were cracked and worn.</p>

<p>Old Baldwin Barnes had bought his house on the
instalment plan, and his children were still paying
for it. Old Baldwin had succumbed to the deadly
monotony of writing the same inscription on red
slips through thirty years of faithful service in the
Pension Office, and had left the world with his
debts behind him.</p>

<p>He had the artistic temperament which his son
inherited. Julia was like her mother who had died
two years before her husband. Mrs. Barnes had
been unimaginative and capable. It was because
of her that Julia had married an architect, and was
living in a snug apartment in Chicago, that Baldwin
Junior had gone through college and had some
months at an art school before the war came on,
and that Jane, the youngest, had a sense of thrift,
and an intensive experience in domestic economy.</p>

<p>As for the rest of her, Jane was twenty, slender
as a Florentine page, and fairly pretty. She was
in love with life and liked to talk about it. Young
Baldwin said, indeed, with the frankness of a
brother, that Jane ran on like a babbling brook.</p>

<p>She was &#8220;running on&#8221; this November morning,
as she and young Baldwin ate breakfast together.
Jane always got the breakfast. Sophy, a capable
negro woman, came over later to help with the
housework, and to put the six o&#8217;clock dinner on the
table. But it was Jane who started the percolator,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
poached the eggs, and made the toast on the electric
toaster, while young Baldwin read the <i>Washington
Post</i>. He read bits out loud when he was
in the mood. He was not always in the mood, and
then Jane talked to him. He did not always listen,
but that made no difference.</p>

<p>Jane had named the percolator &#8220;Philomel,&#8221; because
of its purling harmonies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you love it, Baldy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her brother, with one eye on the paper, was eating
his grapefruit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Love what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Philomel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silly stuff&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t. I like to hear it sing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In my present mood I prefer a hymn of hate.&#8221;</p>

<p>She buttered a slice of toast for him. &#8220;Well, of
course, you&#8217;d feel like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who wouldn&#8217;t?&#8221; He took the toast from her,
and buried himself in his paper, so Jane buttered
another slice for herself and ate it in protesting silence&mdash;plus
a poached egg, and a cup of coffee rich
with yellow cream and much sugar. Jane&#8217;s thinness
made such indulgence possible. She enjoyed
good food as she enjoyed a new frock, violets in the
spring, the vista from the west front of the Capitol,
free verse, and the book of Job. There were really
no limits to Jane&#8217;s enthusiasms. She spoke again
of the percolator. &#8220;It&#8217;s as nice as a kettle on the
hob, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>Young Baldwin read on.</p>

<p>&#8220;I simply <i>love</i> breakfast,&#8221; she continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there anything you don&#8217;t love, Janey?&#8221; with
a touch of irritation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stared at her over the top of the sheet. &#8220;I
like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you won&#8217;t talk to me, Baldy. It isn&#8217;t my
fault if you hate the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t.&#8221; He laid down the paper. &#8220;But
I&#8217;ll tell you this, Janey, I&#8217;m about <i>through</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>She caught her breath, then flung out, &#8220;Oh,
you&#8217;re not. Be a good sport, Baldy. Things are
bound to come your way if you wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave a short laugh and rose. &#8220;I wish I had
your optimism.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you had.&#8221;</p>

<p>They faced each other, looking for the moment
rather like two young cockerels. Jane&#8217;s bobbed
hair emphasized the boyish effect of her straight,
slim figure. Baldy towered above her, his black
hair matching hers, his eyes, too, matching&mdash;gray
and lighted-up.</p>

<p>Jane was the first to turn her eyes away. She
looked at the clock. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be late.&#8221;</p>

<p>He got his hat and coat and came back to her.
&#8220;I&#8217;m a blamed sorehead. Give me a kiss, Janey.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave it to him, and clung to him for a moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget to bring a steak home for
dinner,&#8221; was all she said, but he was aware of the
caress of those clinging fingers.</p>

<p>It was one of his grievances that he had to do
the marketing&mdash;one could not depend on Sherwood&#8217;s
single small store&mdash;so Baldy with dreams
in his head drove twice a week to the butcher&#8217;s
stall in the old Center Market to bring back chops,
or a porterhouse, or a festive small roast.</p>

<p>He had no time for it in the mornings, however.
His little Ford took him over the country roads
and through the city streets and landed him at the
Patent Office at a quarter of nine. There, with a
half hour for lunch, he worked until five&mdash;it was
a dog&#8217;s life and he had other aspirations.</p>

<p>Jane, left to herself, read the paper. One headline
was sensational. The bride of a fashionable
wedding had been deserted at the altar. The bridegroom
had failed to appear at the church. The
guests waiting impatiently in the pews had been informed,
finally, that the ceremony would be postponed.</p>

<p>Newspaper men hunting for the bridegroom
learned that he had left a note for his best man&mdash;and
that he was on his way to southern waters.
The bride could not be seen. Her uncle, who was
also her guardian, and with whom she lived, had
stated that there was nothing to be said. That was
all. But society was on tiptoe. Delafield Simms
was the son of a rich New Yorker. He and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
bride were to have spent their honeymoon on his
yacht. Edith Towne had a fortune to match his.
Both of them belonged to old and aristocratic families.
No wonder people were talking.</p>

<p>There was a picture of Miss Towne, a tall, fair
girl, in real lace, orange blossoms, seed pearls&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>Pride was in every line of her. Jane&#8217;s tender
fancy carried her to that first breathless moment
when the bride had donned that gracious gown and
had surveyed herself in the mirror. &#8220;How happy
she must have been.&#8221; Then the final shuddering
catastrophe.</p>

<p>Sophy arrived at this moment, and Jane told her
about it. &#8220;She&#8217;ll never dare trust anybody, will
she?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sophy was wise, and she weighed the question
out of her wide experience of human nature. She
could not read or write, and she was dependent on
those around her for daily bulletins of the way the
big world went. But she had worked in many
families and had had a family of her own. So she
knew life, which is a bigger thing sometimes than
books.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yo&#8217; kain&#8217;t ever tell whut a woman will do, Miss
Janey. Effen she a trustin&#8217; nature, she&#8217;ll trus&#8217; and
trus&#8217;, and effen she ain&#8217; a trustin&#8217; nature, she won&#8217;t
trus&#8217; nohow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what do you suppose made him do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody knows whut a man&#8217;s gwine do, w&#8217;en it
comes to gittin&#8217; married.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>&#8220;But to leave her like that, Sophy. I should
think she&#8217;d die.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Effen the good Lord let women die w&#8217;en men
&#8217;ceived them,&#8221; Sophy proclaimed with a chuckle,
&#8220;dere wouldn&#8217; be a female lef&#8217; w&#8217;en the trump
sounded.&#8221; Her tray was piled high with dishes, as
she stood in the dining-room door. &#8220;Does you-all
want rice puddin&#8217; fo&#8217; dinnah, Miss Janey?&#8221;</p>

<p>And there the subject dropped. But Jane
thought a great deal about it as she went on with
her work.</p>

<p>She told her sister, Julia, about it when, late that
afternoon, she wrote her weekly letter.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;The worst of it must have been to lose her faith
in things. I&#8217;d rather be Jane Barnes without any
love affair than Edith Towne with a love affair like
that. Baldy told me the other day that I am not
unattractive! Can&#8217;t you see him saying it? And
he doesn&#8217;t think me pretty. Perhaps I&#8217;m not. But
there are moments, Judy, when I like myself&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>&#8220;Baldy nearly had a fit when I bobbed my hair.
But I did it and took the consequences, and it&#8217;s no
end comfortable. Baldy at the present moment is
mid-Victorian. It is his reaction from the war.
He says he is dead sick of flappers. That they are
all alike&mdash;and make no appeal to the imagination!
He came home the other night from a dance and
read Tennyson&mdash;can you fancy that after the way
he used to fling Amy Lowell at us and Carl Sandburg?
He says he is so tired of short skirts and
knees and proposals and cigarettes that he is going
to hunt with a gun, if he ever decides to marry, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
an Elaine or a Griselda! But the worst of it is, he
takes it out on me! I wish you&#8217;d see the way he
censors my clothes and my manners, and I sit here
like a prisoner in a tower with not a man in sight
but Evans Follette, and he is just a heartache,
Judy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Baldy has had three proposals; he said that the
first was stimulating, but repetition &#8216;staled the interest&#8217;!
Of course he didn&#8217;t tell me the names of
the girls. Baldy&#8217;s not a cad.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he is discouraged and desperately depressed.
He has such a big talent, Judy, and
he just slaves away at that old office. He says
that after those years in France, it seems like a
cage. I sometimes wonder what civilization is,
anyhow, that we clip the wings of our young eagles.
We take our boys and shut them up, and they pant
for freedom. Is that all that life is going to mean
for Baldy&mdash;eight hours a day&mdash;behind bars?</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet I am trying to keep him at it until the
house is paid for. I don&#8217;t know whether I am right&mdash;but
it&#8217;s all we have&mdash;and both of us love it. He
hasn&#8217;t been able lately to work much at night, he&#8217;s
dead tired. But there&#8217;s a prize offer of a magazine
cover design, and I want him to compete. He says
there isn&#8217;t any use of his trying to do <i>anything</i> unless
he can give all of his time to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you&#8217;ve heard all this before, but I
hear it every day. And I like to talk things out.
I must not write another line, dearest. And don&#8217;t
worry, Baldy will work like mad if the mood strikes
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I tell you that Evans Follette and his
mother are to dine with us on Thanksgiving Day?
We ought to have six guests to make things go.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
But nobody will fit in with the Follettes. You
know why, so I needn&#8217;t explain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kiss both of the babies for me. Failing other
young things, I am going to have a Christmas tree
for the kitten. It&#8217;s a gay life, darling.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gap">&#8220;Ever your own,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The darkness had come by the time she had finished
her letter. She changed her frock for a thinner
one, wrapped herself in an old cape of orange-hued
cloth, and went out to lock up her chickens.
She had fed them before she wrote her letter, but
she always took this last look to be sure they were
safe.</p>

<p>She passed through the still kitchen, where old
Sophy sat by the warm, bright range. There were
potatoes baking, and Sophy&#8217;s famous pudding.
&#8220;How good everything smells,&#8221; said Jane.</p>

<p>She smiled at Sophy and went on. The wind
was blowing and the sky was clear. There had
been no snow, but there were little pools of ice
about, and Jane took each one with a slide. She
felt a tingling sense of youth and excitation. Back
of the garage was a shadowy grove of tall pines
which sang and sighed as the wind swept them.
There was a young moon above the pines. It
seemed to Jane that her soul was lifted to it. She
flung up her arms to the moon, and the yellow cape
billowed about her.</p>

<p>The shed where the chickens were kept was back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of the garage. When Jane opened the door, her
old Persian cat, Merrymaid, came out to her, and a
puff-ball of a kitten. Jane snapped on the lights
in the chicken-house and the biddies stirred. When
she snapped them off again, she heard them settle
back to sheltered slumber.</p>

<p>The kitten danced ahead of her, and the old cat
danced too, as the wind whirled her great tail
about. &#8220;We won&#8217;t go in the house&mdash;we won&#8217;t go
in the house,&#8221; said Jane, in a sort of conversational
chant, as the pussies followed her down a path
which led through the pines. She often walked
at this hour&mdash;and she loved it best on nights like
this.</p>

<p>She felt poignantly the beauty of it&mdash;the dark
pines and the little moon above them&mdash;the tug of
the wind at her cloak like a riotous playmate.</p>

<p>Baldy was not the only poet in the family, but
Jane&#8217;s love of beauty was inarticulate. She would
never be able to write it on paper or draw it with a
pencil.</p>

<p>Down the path she went, the two pussy-cats like
small shadows in her wake, until suddenly a voice
came out of the dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe it is little Jane Barnes.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped. &#8220;Oh, is that you, Evans? Isn&#8217;t it
a heavenly night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>&#8220;Because an evening like this is like wine&mdash;it
goes to my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are like wine,&#8221; he told her. &#8220;Jane, how
do you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold the pose of youth and joy and happiness?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know it isn&#8217;t a pose. I just feel that way,
Evans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, I believe you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>He limped a little as he walked beside her. He
was tall and gaunt. Almost grotesquely tall. Yet
when he had gone to war he had not seemed in the
least grotesque. He had been tall but not thin, and
he had gone in all the glory of his splendid youth.</p>

<p>There was no glory left. He was twenty-seven.
He had fought and he would fight again for the
same cause. But his youth was dead, except when
he was with Jane. She revived him, as he said,
like wine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was coming over,&#8221; he began, and broke off as
a sibilant sound interrupted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, are the cats with you? Well, Rusty must
take the road,&#8221; he laughed as the little old dog
trotted to neutral ground at the edge of the grove.
Rusty was friends with Merrymaid, except when
there were kittens about. He knew enough to avoid
her in days of anxious motherhood.</p>

<p>Jane picked up the kitten. &#8220;They would come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All animals follow you. You&#8217;re sort of a domestic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Circe&mdash;with your dogs and chickens and
pussy-cats in the place of tigers and lions and
leopards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d love to have lived in Eden,&#8221; said Jane, unexpectedly,
&#8220;before Eve and Adam sinned. What
it must have meant to have all those great beasts
mild-mannered and purring under your hand like
this kitten. What a dreadful thing happened,
Evans, when fear came into the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you say that now, Jane?&#8221; His
voice was sharp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t I have said it? Oh, Evans, you can&#8217;t
think I had you in mind&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; with a touch of weariness, &#8220;but you are
the only one, really, who knows what a coward I
am&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Evans, you&#8217;re not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re good to say it, but that&#8217;s what I came
over for. I am up against it again, Jane. Some
cousins are on from New York&mdash;they&#8217;re at the New
Willard&mdash;and Mother and I went in to see them
last night. They have invited us to go back with
them. They&#8217;ve a big house east of Fifth Avenue,
and they want us as their guests indefinitely.
They think it will do me a lot of good&mdash;get me out
of myself, they call it. But I can&#8217;t see it. Since I
came home&mdash;every time I think of facing mobs of
people&#8221;&mdash;again his voice grew sharp&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m
clutched by something I can&#8217;t describe. It is perfectly
unreasonable, but I can&#8217;t help it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>For a moment they walked in silence, then he
went on&mdash;&#8220;Mother&#8217;s very keen about it. She
thinks it will set me up. But I want to stay here&mdash;and
I thought if you&#8217;d talk to her, she&#8217;ll listen to
you, Jane&mdash;she always does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does she know how you feel about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I think not. I&#8217;ve never told her. I&#8217;ve
only spilled over to you now and then. It would
hurt Mother, no end, to know how changed I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane laid her hand on his arm. &#8220;You&#8217;re not.
Brace up, old dear. You aren&#8217;t dead yet.&#8221; As she
lifted her head to look up at him, the hood of her
cape slipped back, and the wind blew her soft, thick
hair against his cheek. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll talk to your
mother if you want me to. She is a great darling.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane meant what she said; she was really very
fond of Mrs. Follette. And in this she was unlike
the rest of the folk in Sherwood. Mrs. Follette
was extremely unpopular in the Park.</p>

<p>They had reached the kitchen door. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you
come in?&#8221; Jane said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ve got to get back. I only ran over for a
moment. I have to have a daily sip of you, Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Baldy&#8217;s bringing a steak for dinner. Help us
eat it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry, but Mother would be alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When shall I talk to her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no hurry. The cousins are staying on
for the opening of Congress. Jane dear, don&#8217;t despise
me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; His voice broke.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>&#8220;Evans, as if I could.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again her hand was on his arm. He laid his
own over it. &#8220;You&#8217;re the best ever, Janey,&#8221; he
said, huskily&mdash;and presently he went away.</p>

<p>Jane, going in, found that Baldy had telephoned.
&#8220;He kain&#8217;t git here until seven,&#8221; Sophy told
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better run along home,&#8221; Jane told her.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll cook the steak when it comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sophy was old and she was tired. Life hadn&#8217;t
been easy. The son who was to have been the prop
of her old age had been killed in France. There
was a daughter&#8217;s daughter who had gone north and
who now and then sent money. Old Sophy did not
know where her granddaughter got the money, but
it was good to have it when it came. But it was
not enough, so old Sophy worked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hates to leave you here alone, Miss Janey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, run along, Sophy. Baldy will come before
I know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Sophy went and Jane waited. Seven o&#8217;clock
arrived, with the dinner showing signs of deterioration.
Jane sat at the front window and watched.
The old cat watched, too, perched on the sill, and
gazing out into the dark with round, mysterious
eyes. The kitten slept on the hearth. Jane grew
restless and stood up, peering out. Then all at
once two round moons arose above the horizon,
were lost as the road dipped down, showed again
on the rise of the hill, and lighted the lawn as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Baldy&#8217;s car made a half circle and swept into the
garage.</p>

<p>Jane went through the kitchen to the back door,
throwing an appraising glance at the things in the
warming oven, and stood waiting on the threshold,
hugging herself in the keenness of the wind.</p>

<p>Presently her brother&#8217;s tall form was silhouetted
against the silvery gray of the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were never coming,&#8221; she said to
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so, too.&#8221; He bent and kissed her;
his cheek was cold as it touched hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you nearly frozen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Sorry to be late, honey. Get dinner on
the table and I&#8217;ll be ready&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid things won&#8217;t be very appetizing,&#8221;
she told him; &#8220;they&#8217;ve waited so long. But I&#8217;ll
cook the steak&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He had gone on, and was beyond the sound of her
voice. She opened the fat parcel which he had deposited
on the kitchen table. She wondered a bit
at its size. But Baldy had a way of bringing home
unexpected bargains&mdash;a dozen boxes of crackers&mdash;unwieldy
pounds of coffee.</p>

<p>But this was neither crackers nor coffee. The
box which was revealed bore the name of a fashionable
florist. Within were violets&mdash;single ones&mdash;set
off by one perfect rose and tied with a silver ribbon.</p>

<p>Jane gasped&mdash;then she went to the door and
called:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>&#8220;Baldy, where&#8217;s the steak?&#8221;</p>

<p>He came to the top of the stairs. &#8220;Great guns,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;I forgot it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he saw the violets in her hands, laughed
and came down a step or two. &#8220;I sold a loaf of
bread and bought&mdash;white hyacinths&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re heavenly!&#8221; Her glance swept up to
him. &#8220;Peace offering?&#8221;</p>

<p>There were gay sparks in his eyes. &#8220;We&#8217;ll call
it that.&#8221;</p>

<p>She blew a kiss to him from the tips of her fingers.
&#8220;They are perfectly sweet. And we can
have an omelette. Only if we eat any more eggs,
we&#8217;ll be flapping our wings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what we have. I am so hungry I
could eat a house.&#8221; He went back up the stairs,
laughing.</p>

<p>Jane, breaking eggs into a bowl, meditated on
the nonchalance of men. She meditated, too, on
the mystery of Baldy&#8217;s mood. The flowers were
evidence of high exaltation. He did not often lend
himself to such extravagance.</p>

<p>He came down presently and helped carry in the
belated dinner. The potatoes lay like withered
leaves in a silver dish, the cornbread was a wrinkled
wreck, the pudding a travesty. Only Jane&#8217;s
omelette and a lettuce salad had escaped the blight
of delay.</p>

<p>Then, too, there was Philomel, singing. Jane
drew a cup of coffee, hot and strong, and set it at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
her brother&#8217;s place. The violets were in the center
of the table, the cats purring on the hearth.</p>

<p>Jane loved her little home with almost passionate
intensity. She loved to have Baldy in a mood
like this&mdash;things right once more with his world.</p>

<p>She knew it was so by the ring of his voice, the
cock of his head&mdash;hence she was not in the least
surprised when he leaned forward under the old-fashioned
spreading dome which drenched him with
light, and said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve such a lot to tell you, Jane;
the most amazing thing has happened.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />

<small>A PRINCESS PASSES</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> young Baldwin Barnes had ridden out of
Sherwood that morning on his way to Washington,
his car had swept by fields which were crisp and
frozen; by clumps of trees whose pointed tops cut
into the clear blue of the sky; over ice-bound
streams, all shining silver in the early sunlight.</p>

<p>It was very cold, and his little car was open to
the weather. But he felt no chill. He wore the
mustard-colored top-coat which had been his lieutenant&#8217;s
garb in the army. The collar was turned
up to protect his ears. His face showed pink
and wedge-shaped between his soft hat and his
collar.</p>

<p>He had the eye of an artist, and he liked the ride.
Even in winter the countryside was attractive&mdash;and
as the road slipped away, there came a few big
houses surrounded by wide grounds, with glimpses
through their high hedges of white statues, of
spired cedars, of sun-dials set in the midst of dead
gardens.</p>

<p>Beyond these there was an arid stretch until the
Lake was reached, then the links of one country
club, the old buildings of another, and at last on
the crest of a hill, a view of the city&mdash;sweeping on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the right towards Arlington and on the left towards
Soldiers&#8217; Home.</p>

<p>Turning into Sixteenth Street, he crossed a
bridge with its buttresses guarded by stone panthers&mdash;and
it was on this bridge that his car
stopped.</p>

<p>Climbing out, he blamed Fate furiously. Years
afterward, however, he dared not think of the difference
it might have made if his little flivver had
not failed him.</p>

<p>He raised the hood and tapped and tinkered.
Now and then he stopped to stamp his feet or beat
his hands together. And he said things under his
breath. He would be late at the office&mdash;life was
just one&mdash;darned thing&mdash;after another!</p>

<p>Once when he stopped, a woman passed him.
She was tall and slender and wrapped up to her
ears in moleskin. Her small hat was blue, from
her hand swung a gray suede bag, her feet were in
gray shoes with cut-steel buckles.</p>

<p>Baldy&#8217;s quick eyes took in the details of her costume.
He reflected as he went back to work that
women were fools to court death in that fashion,
with thin slippers and silk stockings, in this bitter
weather.</p>

<p>He found the trouble, fixed it, jumped into his
car and started his motor. And it was just as he
was moving that his eye was caught by a spot of
blue bobbing down the hill below the bridge. The
woman who had passed him was making her way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
slowly along the slippery path. On each side of
her the trees were brown and bare. At the foot of
the hill was a thread of frozen water.</p>

<p>It was not usual at this time to see pedestrians
in that place. Now and then a workman took a
short cut&mdash;or on warm days there were picnic
parties&mdash;but to follow the rough paths in winter
was a bleak and arduous adventure.</p>

<p>He stayed for a moment to watch her, then suddenly
left his car and ran. The girl in the blue hat
had caught her high heels in a root, had stumbled
and fallen.</p>

<p>When he reached her, she was struggling to her
feet. He helped her, and picked up the bag which
she had dropped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you so much.&#8221; Her voice was low and
pleasing. He saw that she was young, that her
skin was very fair, and that the hair which swept
over her ears was pale gold, but most of all, he saw
that her eyes were burning blue. He had never
seen eyes quite like them. The old poets would
have called them sapphire, but sapphires do not
flame.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was so silly of me to try to do it,&#8221; she was
protesting, &#8220;but I thought it might be a short
cut&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He wondered what her destination might be that
this remote path should lead to it. But all he said
was, &#8220;High heels aren&#8217;t made for&mdash;mountain
climbing&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>&#8220;They aren&#8217;t made for anything,&#8221; she said, looking
down at the steel-buckled slippers, &#8220;useful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me help you up the hill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go up.&#8221;</p>

<p>He surveyed the steep incline. &#8220;I am perfectly
sure you don&#8217;t want to go down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; she hesitated, &#8220;but I suppose I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had a sudden inspiration. &#8220;Can I take you
anywhere? My little flivver is up there on the
bridge. Would you mind that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would I mind if a life-line were thrown to me
in mid-ocean?&#8221; She said it lightly, but he fancied
there was a note of high hope.</p>

<p>They went up the hill together. &#8220;I want to get
an Alexandria car,&#8221; she told him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are miles away from it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I?&#8221; She showed momentary confusion.
&#8220;I&mdash;hoped I might reach it through the Park&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might. But you might also freeze to death
in the attempt like a babe in the wood, without any
robins to perform the last melancholy rites. What
made you think of such a thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw at once his mistake. Her voice had a
touch of frigidity. &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; he said abruptly. &#8220;You must forgive
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She melted. &#8220;No, it is I who should be forgiven.
It must look strange to you&mdash;but I&#8217;d rather
not&mdash;explain&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>On the last steep rise of the hill he lifted her over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
a slippery pool, and as his hand sank into the soft
fur of her wrap, he was conscious of its luxury. It
seemed to him that his mustard-colored coat fairly
shouted incongruity. His imagination swept on to
Raleigh, and the velvet cloak which might do the
situation justice. He smiled at himself and smiling,
too, at her, felt a tingling sense of coming circumstance.</p>

<p>It was because of that smile, and the candid, boyish
quality of it, that she trusted him. &#8220;Do you
know,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t had a thing to eat this
morning, and I&#8217;m frightfully hungry. Is there any
place that I could have a cup of coffee&mdash;where you
could bring it out to me in the car?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could I?&#8221; the morning stars sang. &#8220;There&#8217;s
a corking place in Georgetown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Without the world looking on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Without <i>your</i> world looking on,&#8221; boldly.</p>

<p>She hesitated, then told the truth. &#8220;I&#8217;m running
away&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He was eager. &#8220;May I help?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you wouldn&#8217;t if you knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He helped her into his car, tucked the rug about
her, and put up the curtains. &#8220;No one can see you
on the back seat,&#8221; he said, and drove to Georgetown
on the wings of the wind.</p>

<p>He brought coffee out to her from a neat shop
where milk was sold, and buns, and hot drinks, to
motormen and conductors. It was a clean little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
place, fresh as paint, and the buttered rolls were
brown and crisp.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never tasted anything so good,&#8221; the runaway
told Baldy. &#8220;And now I am going to ask you to
drive me over the Virginia side&mdash;I&#8217;ll get the trolley
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>When at last he drew up at a little way station,
and unfastened the curtain, he was aware that she
had opened the suede bag and had a roll of bills in
her hand. For a moment his heart failed him.
Was she going to offer him money?</p>

<p>But what she said, with cheeks flaming, was:
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t anything less than ten dollars. Do you
think they will take it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s doubtful. I have oodles of change.&#8221; He
held out a handful of silver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you so much, and&mdash;you must let me have
your card&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice had an edge of sharpness. &#8220;Of course
it must be a loan.&#8221;</p>

<p>He handed her his card in silence. She read the
name. &#8220;Mr. Barnes, you have been very kind. I
am tremendously grateful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not kindness&mdash;but now and then a princess
passes.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a breathless moment her amazed glance met
his&mdash;then the clang of a bell heralded an approaching
car.</p>

<p>As he helped her out hurriedly she stumbled over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the rug. He caught her up, lifted her to the
ground, and motioned to the motorman.</p>

<p>The car stopped and she mounted the steps.
&#8220;Good-bye, and thank you so much.&#8221; He stood
back and she waved to him while he watched her
out of sight.</p>

<p>His work at the office that morning had dreams
for an accompaniment. He went out at lunch-time
but ate nothing. It was at lunch-time that he
bought the violets&mdash;paying an unthinkable price
for them, and not caring.</p>

<p>He had wild thoughts of following the road to
Alexandria&mdash;of finding his Juliet on some balcony
and climbing up to her. Or of sending the flowers
forth addressed largely to &#8220;A Princess who passed.&#8221;
One could not, however, be sure of an uncomprehending
mail service. He would need more definite
appellation.</p>

<p>He had not, indeed, bought the flowers for Jane.
He had had no thought of his sister as he passed the
florist&#8217;s window. He had been drawn into the shop
by the association of ideas&mdash;when he entered all the
scent and sweetness seemed to belong to a garden
in which his lady walked.</p>

<p>He did not eat any lunch, and he took the box of
violets back with him to the office, wrapped to prodigious
size to protect it from the cold. It was an
object of much curiosity to his fellow-clerks as it
sat on the window-sill. They all wanted to know
who it was for, and one of the abhorred flappers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
who, at times, took Baldy&#8217;s dictation, tried to peep
between the covers.</p>

<p>He felt that her glance would be desecration.
What did she know of delicate fragrances? Her
perfumes were oriental, and she used a lipstick!</p>

<p>He managed, however, to carry the thing off
lightly. He was, in the opinion of the office, a gay
and companionable chap. They knew nothing of
his reactions. And he was popular.</p>

<p>So now he said to the girl, &#8220;If you&#8217;ll let
that alone, I&#8217;ll bring a box of chocolates for the
crowd.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t I look at it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because curiosity is a deadly sin. You know
what happened to Bluebeard&#8217;s wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Bluebeard.&#8221; She had read of him, she
thought, in the Paris papers. He had killed a lot
of wives. She giggled a little in deference to the
spiciness of the subject. Then pinned him down to
his promise of sweets. &#8220;You know the kind we
like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This week?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Butter creams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Last week it was the nut kind. One never
knows. I should think you ought to standardize
your tastes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be stupid, wouldn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s much
more exciting to change.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went back to his work and forgot her. She
was one of the butterflies who had flitted to Washington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
during the war, and had set that conservative
city by the ears in defiance of tradition.</p>

<p>It was these young women who had eaten their
lunches within the sacred precincts of Lafayette
Square, draping themselves on its statues at noon-time,
and strewing its immaculate sward with
broken boxes and bags, who had worn sheer and insufficient
clothing, had motored under the moon
and without a moon, unchaperoned, until morning,
and had come through it all a little damaged, perhaps,
as to ideals, but having made a definite impress
on the life of the capital. The days of the
cave-dwellers were dead. For better, for worse,
the war-worker and the women of old Washington
had been swept out together from a safe and snug
harbor into the raging seas of social readjustment.</p>

<p>It was after office that Baldy carried the flowers
to his car. He set the box on the back seat. In
the hurry of the morning he had forgotten the rug
which still lay where his fair passenger had stumbled
over it. He picked it up and something
dropped from its folds. It was the gray suede bag,
half open, and showing the roll of bills. Beneath
the roll of bills was a small sheer handkerchief, a
vanity case with a pinch of powder and a wee puff,
a new check-book&mdash;and, negligently at the very bottom,
a ring&mdash;a ring of such enchantment that as it
lay in Baldy&#8217;s hand, he doubted its reality. The
hoop was of platinum, slender, yet strong enough
to bear up a carved moonstone in a circle of diamonds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
The carving showed a delicate Psyche&mdash;with
a butterfly on her shoulder. The diamonds
blazed like small suns.</p>

<p>Inside the ring was an inscription&mdash;&#8220;Del to
Edith&mdash;Forever.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Del to Edith?</i> Where had he seen those names?
With a sudden flash of illumination, he dropped
the ring back into the bag, stuffed the bag in his
pocket, and made his way to a newsboy at the
corner.</p>

<p>There it was in startling headlines: <i>Edith Towne
Disappears. Delafield Simms&#8217; Yacht Said to Have
Been Sighted Near Norfolk!</i></p>

<p>So his passenger had been the much-talked-about
Edith Towne&mdash;deserted at the moment of her marriage!</p>

<p>He thought of her eyes of burning blue,&mdash;the
fairness of her skin and hair&mdash;the touch of haughtiness.
Simms was a cur, of course! He should
have knelt at her feet!</p>

<p>The thing to do was to get the bag back to
her. He must advertise at once. On the wings of
this decision, his car whirled down the Avenue.
The lines which, after much deliberation, he pushed
across the counter of the newspaper office, would be
ambiguous to others, but clear to her. &#8220;Will passenger
who left bag with valuable contents in Ford
car call up Sherwood Park 49.&#8221;</p>

<small>JANE KNITS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Is</span> she really as beautiful as that?&#8221; Jane demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;As what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her picture in the paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t I said enough for you to know it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane nodded. &#8220;Yes. But it doesn&#8217;t sound real
to me. Are you sure you didn&#8217;t dream it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say I didn&#8217;t. Isn&#8217;t that the proof?&#8221; The
gray bag lay on the table in front of them, the ring
was on Jane&#8217;s finger.</p>

<p>She turned it to catch the light. &#8220;Baldy,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;it&#8217;s beyond imagination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think of having a ring like this&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think,&#8221; fiercely, &#8220;of having a lover who ran
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jane, &#8220;there are some advantages
in being&mdash;unsought. I&#8217;m like the Miller-ess of
Dee&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>She sang it with a light boyish swing of her body.
Her voice was girlish and sweet, with a touch of
huskiness.</p>

<p>Baldy flung his scorn at her. &#8220;Jane, aren&#8217;t you
ever in earnest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Intermittently,&#8221; she smiled at him, came over
and tucked her arm in his. &#8220;Baldy,&#8221; she coaxed,
&#8220;aren&#8217;t you going to tell her uncle?&#8221;</p>

<p>He stared at her. &#8220;Her uncle? Tell him what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you&#8217;ve found the bag.&#8221;</p>

<p>He flung off her arm. &#8220;Would you have me turn
traitor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavens, Baldy, this isn&#8217;t melodrama. It&#8217;s
common sense. You can&#8217;t keep that bag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can keep it until she answers my advertisement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She may never see your advertisement, and the
money isn&#8217;t yours, and the ring isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was troubled. &#8220;But she trusted me. I can&#8217;t
do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane shrugged her shoulders, and began to clear
away the dinner things. Baldy helped her. Old
Merrymaid mewed to go out, and Jane opened the
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s snowing hard,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>The wind drove the flakes across the threshold.
Old Merrymaid danced back into the house, bright-eyed
and round as a muff. The air was freezing.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is going to be a dreadful night,&#8221; young Baldwin,
heavy with gloom, prophesied. He thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Edith, in the storm in her buckled shoes. Had
she found shelter? Was she frightened and alone
somewhere in the dark?</p>

<p>He went into the living-room, whence Jane presently
followed him. Jane was knitting a sweater
and she worked while Baldy read to her. He read
the full account of Edith Towne&#8217;s flight. She had
gone away early in the morning. The maid, taking
her breakfast up to her, had found the room empty.
She had left a note for her uncle. But he had not
permitted its publication. He was, they said, wild
with anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet he&#8217;s an old tyrant,&#8221; was Baldy&#8217;s comment.</p>

<p>Frederick Towne&#8217;s picture was in the paper. &#8220;I
like his face,&#8221; said Jane, &#8220;and he doesn&#8217;t seem so
frightfully old.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should she run away from him, if he
wasn&#8217;t a tyrant?&#8221; he demanded furiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t scold me.&#8221; Jane was as vivid as an
oriole in the midst of her orange wools.</p>

<p>She loved color. The living-room was an expression
of it. Its furniture was old-fashioned but not
old-fashioned enough to be lovely. Jane had, however,
modified its lack of grace and its dull monotonies
by covers of chintz&mdash;tropical birds against
black and white stripes&mdash;and there was a lamp of
dull blue pottery with a Chinese shade. A fire in
the coal grate, with the glow of the lamp, gave the
room a look of burnished brightness. The kitten,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
curled up in Jane&#8217;s lap, played cozily with the
tawny threads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t scold me,&#8221; said Jane, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t my fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not scolding, but I&#8217;m worried to death.
And you aren&#8217;t any help, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him in astonishment. &#8220;I&#8217;ve tried
to help. I told you to call up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Baldwin walked the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;She trusted me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t get anywhere with that,&#8221; said Jane
with decision. &#8220;The thing to do is to tell Mr.
Towne that you have news of her, and that you&#8217;ll
give it only under promise that he won&#8217;t do anything
until he has talked it over with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds better,&#8221; said young Baldwin;
&#8220;how did you happen to think of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now and then,&#8221; said Jane, &#8220;I have ideas.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baldy went to the telephone. When he came
back his eyes were like gray moons. &#8220;He promised
everything, and he&#8217;s coming out&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he wouldn&#8217;t wait until to-morrow. He&#8217;s
wild about her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he would be.&#8221; Jane mentally surveyed
the situation. &#8220;Baldy, I&#8217;m going to make some
coffee, and have some cheese and crackers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He may not want them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On a cold night like this, I&#8217;ll say he will; anybody
would.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baldy helped Jane get out the round-bellied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
silver pot, the pitchers and tray. The young people
had a sense of complacency as they handled the
old silver. Frederick Towne could have nothing of
more distinguished history. It had belonged to their
great-grandmother, Dabney, who was really D&#8217;Aubigne,
and it had graced an Emperor&#8217;s table. Each
piece had a monogram set in an engraved wreath.
The big tray was so heavy that Jane lifted it with
difficulty, so Baldy set it for her on the little mahogany
table which they drew up in front of the
fire. There was no wealth now in the Barnes family,
but the old silver spoke of a time when a young
hostess as black-haired as Jane had dispensed lavish
hospitality.</p>

<p>Frederick Towne had not expected what he
found&mdash;the little house set high on its terraces
seemed to give from its golden-lighted window
squares a welcome in the dark. &#8220;I shan&#8217;t be long,
Briggs,&#8221; he said to his chauffeur.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good, sir,&#8221; said Briggs, and led the way
up the terrace.</p>

<p>Baldy ushered Towne into the living-room, and
Frederick, standing on the threshold, surveyed a
coziness which reminded him of nothing so much as
a color illustration in some old English magazine.
There was the coal grate, the table drawn up to the
fire, the twinkling silver on its massive tray, violets
in a low vase&mdash;and rising to meet him a slender,
glowing child, with a banner of orange wool behind
her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>&#8220;Jane,&#8221; said young Barnes, &#8220;may I present Mr.
Towne?&#8221; and Jane held out her hand and said,
&#8220;This is very good of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He found himself unexpectedly gracious. He
was not always gracious. He had felt that he
couldn&#8217;t be. A man with money and position had
to shut himself up sometimes in a shell of reserve,
lest he be imposed upon.</p>

<p>But in this warmth and fragrance he expanded.
&#8220;What a charming room,&#8221; he said, and smiled at
her.</p>

<p>Her first view of him confirmed the opinion she
formed from his picture. He was apparently not
over forty, a stocky, well-built, ruddy man, with
fair hair that waved crisply, and with clear blue
eyes, lighter, she learned afterward, than Edith&#8217;s,
but with just a hint of that burning blue. He had
the air of indefinable finish which speaks of a life
spent in the right school and the right college, and
the right clubs, of a background of generations of
good blood and good breeding. He wore evening
clothes, and one knew somehow that dinner never
found him without them.</p>

<p>Yet in spite of these evidences of pomp and circumstance,
Jane felt perfectly at ease with him.
He was, after all, she reflected, only a gentleman,
and Baldy was that. The only difference lay in
their divergent incomes. So, as the two men talked,
she knitted on, with the outward effect of placidity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want me to go?&#8221; she had asked them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and Towne had replied promptly, &#8220;Certainly not.
There&#8217;s nothing we have to say that you can&#8217;t
hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Jane listened with all her ears, and modified
the opinion she had formed of Frederick Towne
from his picture and from her first glimpse of him.
He was nice to talk to, but he might be hard to live
with. He had obstinacy and egotism.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why Edith should have done it amazes me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane, naughtily remembering the Admiral&#8217;s song
from Pinafore which had been her father&#8217;s favorite,
found it beating in her head&mdash;<i>My amazement,
my surprise, you may learn from the expression of
my eyes&mdash;&mdash;</i></p>

<p>But no hint of this showed in her manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;She was hurt,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and she wanted to
hide.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But people seem to think that in some way it is
my fault. I don&#8217;t like that. It isn&#8217;t fair. We&#8217;ve
always been the best of friends&mdash;more like brother
and sister than niece and uncle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But not like Baldy and me,&#8221; said Jane to herself,
&#8220;not in the least like Baldy and me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course Simms ought to be shot,&#8221; Towne told
them heatedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He ought to be hanged,&#8221; was Baldy&#8217;s amendment.</p>

<p>Jane&#8217;s needles clicked, but she said nothing. She
was dying to tell these bloodthirsty males what she
thought of them. What good would it do to shoot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Delafield Simms? A woman&#8217;s hurt pride isn&#8217;t to
be healed by the thought of a man&#8217;s dead body.</p>

<p>Young Baldwin brought out the bag. &#8220;It is one
that Delafield gave her,&#8221; Frederick stated, &#8220;and I
cashed a check for her at the bank the day before
the wedding. I can&#8217;t imagine why she took the
ring with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She probably forgot to take it off; her mind
wasn&#8217;t on <i>rings</i>.&#8221; Jane&#8217;s voice was warm with
feeling.</p>

<p>He looked at her with some curiosity. &#8220;What
was it on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, her heart was broken. Nothing else mattered.
Can&#8217;t you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated for a moment before he spoke. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t believe it was broken. I hardly think she
loved him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baldy blazed, &#8220;But why should she marry him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, it was a good match. A very good
match. And Edith&#8217;s not in the least emotional&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; said Jane pleasantly.</p>

<p>Baldy was silent. Was Frederick Towne blind
to the wonders that lay behind those eyes of burning
blue?</p>

<p>Jane swept them back to the matter of the bag.
&#8220;We thought you ought to have it, Mr. Towne, but
Baldy had scruples about revealing anything he
knows about Miss Towne&#8217;s hiding-place. He feels
that she trusted him.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>&#8220;You said you had advertised, Mr. Barnes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the one thing is to get her home. Tell
her that if she calls you up.&#8221; Frederick looked
suddenly tired and old.</p>

<p>Baldy, leaning against the mantel, gazed down at
him. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to decide what I ought to do.
But I feel that I&#8217;m right in giving her a chance first
to answer the advertisement.&#8221;</p>

<p>Towne&#8217;s tone showed a touch of irritation. &#8220;Of
course you&#8217;ll have to act as you think best.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now Jane took things in her own hands.
&#8220;Mr. Towne, I&#8217;m going to make you a cup of coffee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be very grateful,&#8221; he smiled at her.
What a charming child she was! He was soothed
and refreshed by the atmosphere they created.
This boy and girl were a friendly pair and he loved
his ease. His own house, since Edith&#8217;s departure,
had been funereal, and his friends had been divided
in their championship between himself and Edith.
But the young Barneses were so pleasantly responsive
with their lighted-up eyes and their little
air of making him one with them. Edith had always
seemed to put him quite definitely on the
shelf. With little Jane and her brother he had a
feeling of equality of age.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he spoke impulsively, &#8220;may I tell
you all about it? It would relieve my mind immensely.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>To Jane it was a thrilling moment. Having
poured the coffee, she came out from behind her
battlement of silver and sat in her chintz chair.
She did not knit; she was enchanted by the tale
that Towne was telling. She sat very still, her
hands folded, the tropical birds about her. To
Frederick she seemed like a bird herself&mdash;slim and
lovely, and with a voice that sang!</p>

<p>Towne was not an impressionable man. His
years of bachelorhood had hardened him to feminine
arts. But here was no artfulness. Jane assumed
nothing. She was herself. As he talked to
her, he became aware of some stirred emotion. An
almost youthful eagerness to shine as the hero of
his tale. If he embroidered the theme, it was for
her benefit. What he told was as he saw it. But
what he told was not the truth, nor even half of it.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>BEAUTY WAITS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Edith Towne</span> had lived with her Uncle Frederick
nearly four years when she became engaged to
Delafield Simms. Her mother was dead, as was
her father. Frederick was her father&#8217;s only
brother, and had a big house to himself, after his
mother&#8217;s death. It seemed the only haven for his
niece, so he asked her, and asked also his father&#8217;s
cousin, Annabel Towne, to keep house for him, and
chaperone Edith.</p>

<p>Annabel was over sixty, and rather indefinite,
but she served to play propriety, and there was
nothing else demanded of her in Frederick&#8217;s household
of six servants. She was a dried-up and
desiccated person, with fixed ideas of what one
owed to society. Frederick&#8217;s mother had been like
that, so he did not mind. He rather liked to think
that the woman of his family kept to old ideals. It
gave to things an air of dignity.</p>

<p>Edith, when she came, was different. So different
that Frederick was glad that she had three
more years at college before she would spend the
winters with him. The summers were not hard to
arrange. Edith and Annabel adjourned to the
Towne cottage on an island in Maine&mdash;and Frederick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
went up for week-ends and for the month of
August. Edith spent much time out-of-doors with
her young friends. She was rather fond of her
Uncle Fred, but he did not loom large on the horizon
of her youthful occupations.</p>

<p>Then came her winter at home, and her consequent
engagement to Delafield Simms. It was because
of Uncle Fred that she became engaged. She
simply didn&#8217;t want to live with him any more. She
felt that Uncle Fred would be glad to have her go,
and the feeling was mutual. She was an elephant
on his hands. Naturally. He was a great old
dear, but he was a Turk. He didn&#8217;t know it, of
course. But his ideas of being master of his own
house were perfectly archaic. Cousin Annabel and
the servants, and everybody in his office simply
hung on his words, and Edith wouldn&#8217;t hang. She
came into his bachelor Paradise like a rather troublesome
Eve, and demanded her share of the universe.
He didn&#8217;t like it, and there you were.</p>

<p>It was really Uncle Fred who wanted her to
marry Delafield Simms. He talked about it a lot.
At first Edith wouldn&#8217;t listen. But Delafield was
persistent and patient. He came gradually to be
as much of a part of her everyday life as the meals
she ate or the car she drove. Uncle Fred was always
inviting him. He was forever on hand, and
when he wasn&#8217;t she missed him.</p>

<p>They felt for each other, she decided, the thing
called &#8220;love.&#8221; It was not, perhaps, the romance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
which one found in books. But she had been
taught carefully at college to distrust romance.
The emphasis had been laid on the transient quality
of adolescent emotion. One married for the
sake of the race, and one chose, quite logically,
with one&#8217;s head instead, as in the old days, with the
heart.</p>

<p>So there you had it. Delafield was eligible. He
was healthy, had brains enough, an acceptable code
of morals&mdash;and was willing to let her have her own
way. If there were moments when Edith wondered
if this program was adequate to wedded bliss, she
put the thought aside. She and Delafield liked
each other no end. Why worry?</p>

<p>And really at times Uncle Fred was impossible.
His mother had lived until he was thirty-five, she
had adored him, and had passed on to Cousin Annabel
and to the old servants in the house the formula
by which she had made her son happy. Her
one fear had been that he might marry. He was
extremely popular, much sought after. But he
had kept his heart at home. His sweetheart, he
had often said, was silver-haired and over sixty.
He basked in her approbation; was soothed and
sustained by it.</p>

<p>Then she had died, and Edith had come, and
things had been different.</p>

<p>The difference had been demonstrated in a dozen
ways. Edith was pleasantly affectionate, but she
didn&#8217;t yield an inch. &#8220;Dear Uncle Fred,&#8221; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
would ask, when they disagreed on matters of manners
or morals, or art or athletics, or religion or the
lack of it, &#8220;isn&#8217;t my opinion as good as yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Apparently my opinion isn&#8217;t worth anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes it is&mdash;but you must let me have mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her independence met his rules and broke them.
Her frankness of speech came up against his polite
reticences and they both said things.</p>

<p>Frederick, of course, blamed Edith when she
made him forget his manners. They had, he held,
been considered perfect. Edith retorted that they
had, perhaps, never been challenged. &#8220;It is easy
enough, of course, when everybody gives in to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had brought into his house an atmosphere of
modernity which appalled him. She went and
came as she pleased, would not be bound by old
standards.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Uncle Fred,&#8221; she would say when he protested,
&#8220;the war changed things. Women of to-day
aren&#8217;t sheep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The women of our family,&#8221; her uncle would begin,
to be stopped by the scornful retort, &#8220;Why do
you want the women of your family to be different
from the others you go with?&#8221;</p>

<p>She had him there. His sophistication matched
that of the others of his set. Socially he was
neither a Puritan nor a Pharisee. It was only
under his own roof that he became patriarchal.</p>

<p>Yet, as time went on, he learned that Edith&#8217;s
faults were tempered by her fastidiousness. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
did not confuse liberty and license. She neither
smoked nor drank. There was about her dancing
a fine and stately quality which saved it from sensuousness.
Yet when he told her things, there was
always that irritating shrug of the shoulders.
&#8220;Oh, well, I&#8217;m not a rowdy,&mdash;you know that. But
I like to play around.&#8221;</p>

<p>His pride in her grew&mdash;in her burnished hair, the
burning blue of her eyes, her great beauty, the fineness
of her spirit, the integrity of her character.</p>

<p>Yet he sighed with relief when she told him of
her engagement to Delafield Simms. He loved her,
but none the less he felt the strain of her presence
in his establishment. It would be like sinking back
into the luxury of a feather bed, to take up the old
life where she had entered it.</p>

<p>And Edith, too, welcomed her emancipation.
&#8220;When I marry you,&#8221; she told Delafield, &#8220;I am
going to break all the rules. In Uncle Fred&#8217;s house
everything runs by clockwork, and it is he who
winds the clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delafield laughed and kissed her. He was like
the rest of the men of his generation, apparently
acquiescent. Yet the chances were that when
Edith was his wife, he, too, would wind the clock!</p>

<p>Their engagement was one of mutual freedom.
Edith did as she pleased, Delafield did as he
pleased. They rarely clashed. And as the wedding
day approached, they were pleasantly complacent.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>Delafield, dictating a letter one day to Frederick
Towne&#8217;s stenographer, spoke of his complacency.
He was writing to Bob Sterling, who was to be his
best man, and who shared his apartment in New
York. Delafield was an orphan, and had big money
interests. He felt that Washington was tame compared
to the metropolis. He and Edith were to
live one block east of Fifth Avenue, in a house that
he had bought for her.</p>

<p>When he was in Washington he occupied a desk
in Frederick&#8217;s office. Lucy Logan took his dictation.
She had been for several years with Towne.
She was twenty-three, well-groomed, and self-possessed.
She had slender, flexible fingers, and Delafield
liked to look at them. She had soft brown
hair, and her profile, as she bent over her book, was
clear-cut and composed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Edith and I are great pals,&#8221; he dictated. &#8220;I
rather think we are going to hit it off famously.
I&#8217;d hate to have a woman hang around my neck.
And I want you for my best man. I know it is asking
a lot, but it&#8217;s just once in a lifetime, old chap.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Lucy wrote that and waited with her pencil
poised.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about all,&#8221; said Delafield.</p>

<p>Lucy shut up her book and rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; Delafield decided. &#8220;I want to
add a postscript.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucy sat down.</p>



<blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; Delafield dictated, &#8220;I wish you&#8217;d
order the flowers at Tolley&#8217;s. White orchids for
Edith of course. He&#8217;ll know the right thing for
the bridesmaids&mdash;I&#8217;ll get Edith to send him the
color scheme&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Lucy&#8217;s pencil dashed and dotted. She looked
up, hesitated. &#8220;Miss Towne doesn&#8217;t care for orchids.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>She fluttered the leaves of her notebook and
found an order from Towne to a local florist. &#8220;He
says here, &#8216;Anything but orchids&mdash;she doesn&#8217;t like
them.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve been sending her orchids every week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps she didn&#8217;t want to tell you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you think I should have something else for
the wedding bouquet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think she might like it better.&#8221; There was a
faint flush on her cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you suggest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t be sure what Miss Towne would like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you like?&#8221; intently.</p>

<p>She considered it seriously&mdash;her slender fingers
clasped on her book. &#8220;I think,&#8221; she told him,
finally, &#8220;that if I were going to marry a man I
should want what he wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed and leaned forward. &#8220;Good heavens,
are there any women like that left in the
world?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her flush deepened, she rose and went towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the door. &#8220;Perhaps I shouldn&#8217;t have said anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice changed. &#8220;Indeed, I am glad you
did.&#8221; He had risen and now held the door open
for her. &#8220;We men are stupid creatures. I should
never have found it out for myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went away, and he sat there thinking about
her. Her impersonal manner had always been perfect,
and he had found her little flush charming.</p>

<p>It was because of Lucy Logan, therefore, that
Edith had white violets instead of orchids in her
wedding bouquet. And it was because, too, of Lucy
Logan, that other things happened. Three of
Edith&#8217;s bridesmaids were house-guests. Their
names were Rosalind, Helen and Margaret. They
had, of course, last names, but these have nothing
to do with the story. They had been Edith&#8217;s classmates
at college, and she had been somewhat democratic
in her selection of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are perfect dears, Uncle Fred. I&#8217;ll have
three cave-dwellers to balance them. Socially, I
suppose, it will be a case of sheep and goats, but the
goats are&mdash;darling.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were, however, the six of them, what Delafield
called a bunch of beauties. Their bridesmaid
gowns were exquisite&mdash;but unobtrusive. The
color scheme was blue and silver&mdash;and the flowers,
forget-me-nots and sweet peas. &#8220;It&#8217;s a bit old-fashioned,&#8221;
Edith said, &#8220;but I hate sensational effects.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>Neither the sheep nor the goats agreed with her.
Their ideas were different&mdash;the goats holding out
for something impressionistic, the sheep for ceremonial
splendor.</p>

<p>There was to be a wedding breakfast at the house.
Things were therefore given over early to the decorators
and caterers, and coffee and rolls were
served in everybody&#8217;s room. Belated wedding
presents kept coming, and Edith and her bridal attendants
might be seen at all times on the stairs or
in the hall in silken morning coats and delicious
caps.</p>

<p>When the wedding bouquet arrived Edith sought
out her uncle in his study on the second floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at this,&#8221; she said; &#8220;how in the world did
it happen that he sent white violets? Did you tell
him, Uncle Fred?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cross my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had had their joke about Del&#8217;s orchids.
&#8220;If he knew how I hated them,&#8221; Edith would say,
and Uncle Fred would answer, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you tell
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>But she had never told, because after all it didn&#8217;t
much matter, and if Delafield felt that orchids were
the proper thing, why muddle up his mind with her
preferences?</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; she said now, &#8220;I am glad my wedding
bouquet is different.&#8221; As she stood there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
lovely in her sheer draperies, the fragrant mass of
flowers in her arms, her eyes looked at him over the
top, wistfully. &#8220;Uncle Fred,&#8221; she asked, unexpectedly,
&#8220;do you love me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t say it that way&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Her voice
caught.</p>

<p>&#8220;How shall I say it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As if you&mdash;cared.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood up and put his hands on her shoulders.
&#8220;My dear child,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been no end good to me,&#8221; she said, and
dropped the bouquet on a chair and clung to him,
sobbing.</p>

<p>He held her in his arms and soothed her. &#8220;Being
a bride is a bit nerve-racking.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded. &#8220;And I mustn&#8217;t let my eyes get
red.&#8221;</p>

<p>She kissed him shyly on the cheek. They had
never indulged much in kisses. He felt if she had
always been as sweetly feminine, he should have
been sorry to have her marry.</p>

<p>He did not see her again until she was in her
wedding gown, composed and smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has Del called you up?&#8221; he asked her.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, why should he?&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed. &#8220;Oh, well, you&#8217;ll have plenty to
say to each other afterward.&#8221; But the thought intruded
that with such a bride a man might show
himself, on this day of days, ardent and eager.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>Rosalind and Helen and Margaret, shimmering,
opalescent, their young eyes radiant under their
wide hats, joined the other bridesmaids in the great
limousine which was to take them to the church.
Cousin Annabel went with other cousins. Edith
and her uncle were alone in their car. Frederick&#8217;s
man, Briggs, who had been the family coachman in
the days of horses, drove them.</p>

<p>Washington was shining under the winter sun
as they whirled through the streets to the old
church. &#8220;Happy is the bride the sun shines on,&#8221;
said Frederick, feeling rather foolish. It was
somewhat difficult to talk naturally to this smiling
beauty in her bridal white. She seemed miles removed
from the aggressive maiden with whom he
had fought and made up and fought again.</p>

<p>The wedding party was assembled in one of the
side rooms. Belated guests trickled in a thin
stream towards the great doors that opened and
shut to admit them to the main auditorium. A
group of servants, laden with wraps, stood at the
foot of the stairs. As soon as the procession
started they would go up into the gallery to view
the ceremony.</p>

<p>In the small room was almost overpowering fragrance.
The bridesmaids, in the filtered light, were
a blur of rose and blue and white. There was
much laughter, the sound of the organ through the
thick walls.</p>

<p>Then the ushers came in.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Del?&#8221;</p>

<p>The bridegroom was, it seemed, delayed. They
waited.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we telephone, Mr. Towne?&#8221; someone
asked at last.</p>

<p>Frederick nodded. He and his niece stood apart
from the rest. Edith was smiling but had little to
say. She seemed separated from the others by the
fact of the approaching mystery.</p>

<p>The laughter had ceased; above the whispers
came the tremulous echo of the organ.</p>

<p>The usher who had gone to the telephone returned
and drew Towne aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something queer about it. I can&#8217;t get
Del or Bob. They may be on the way. But the
clerk seemed reticent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go to the &#8217;phone myself,&#8221; said Frederick.
&#8220;Where is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>But he was saved the effort, for someone, watching
at the door, said, &#8220;Here they come,&#8221; and the
room seemed to sigh with relief as Bob Sterling entered.</p>

<p>No one was with him, and he wore a worried
frown.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I speak to you, Mr. Towne?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Edith was standing by the window looking out at
the old churchyard. The uneasiness which had infected
the others had not touched her. Slender
and white she stood waiting. In a few minutes
Del would walk up the aisle with her and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
would be married. In her mind that program was
as fixed as the stars.</p>

<p>And now her uncle approached and said something.
&#8220;Edith, Del isn&#8217;t coming&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to Heaven he were dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Uncle Fred?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you&mdash;presently. But we must get away
from this&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>His glance took in the changed scene. A blight
had swept over those high young heads. Two of
the bridesmaids were crying. The ushers had withdrawn
into a huddled group. The servants were
staring&mdash;uncertain what to do.</p>

<p>Somebody got Briggs and the big car to the door.</p>

<p>Shut into it, Towne told Edith:</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s backed out of it. He left&mdash;this.&#8221; He
had a note in his hand. &#8220;It was written to Bob
Sterling. Bob was with him at breakfast time,
and when he came back, this was on Del&#8217;s dresser.&#8221;</p>

<p>She read it, her blue eyes hot:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t go through with it, Bob. I know it&#8217;s a
rotten trick, but time will prove that I am right.
And Edith will thank me.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Del.</span>&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>She crushed it in her hand. &#8220;Where has he
gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;South, probably, on his yacht.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t there any word for me?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there any other&mdash;woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks like it. Bob is utterly at sea. So is
everybody else.&#8221;</p>

<p>All of her but her eyes seemed frozen. The
great bouquet lay at her feet where she had dropped
it. Her hands were clenched.</p>

<p>Towne laid his hand on hers. &#8220;My dear&mdash;it&#8217;s
dreadful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s a cur&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t do any good to call him names, Uncle
Fred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you must look upon it as a great escape,
Edith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Escape from what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unhappiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I can ever escape from the
thought of this?&#8221; The strong sweep of her arm
seemed to indicate her bridal finery.</p>

<p>He sat in unhappy silence, and suddenly she
laughed. &#8220;I might have known when he kept sending
me orchids. When a man loves a woman he
knows the things she likes.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was then that Towne made his mistake. &#8220;You
ought to thank your lucky stars&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She blazed out at him, &#8220;Uncle Fred, if you say
anything more like that,&mdash;it&#8217;s utterly idiotic. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
you won&#8217;t face <i>facts</i>. Your generation never does.
I&#8217;m not in the least thankful. I&#8217;m simply furious.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an hysterical note in her voice, but he
was unconscious of the tension. She was not taking
it in the least as he wished she might. She
should have wept on his shoulder. Melted to tears
he might have soothed her. But there were no
tears in those blue eyes.</p>

<p>She trod on her flowers as she left the car. Looking
straight ahead of her she ascended the steps.
Within everything was in readiness for the wedding
festivities. The stairway was terraced with
hydrangeas, pink and white and blue. In the
drawing-room were rose garlands with floating ribbons.
And there was a vista of the dining-room&mdash;with
the caterer&#8217;s men already at their posts.</p>

<p>Except for these men, a maid or two&mdash;and a detective
to keep his eye on things, the house was
empty. Everybody had gone to the wedding, and
presently everybody would come back. The house
would be stripped, the flowers would fade, the caterers
would carry away the wasted food.</p>

<p>Edith stopped at the foot of the stairs. &#8220;How
did they announce it at the church?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That it had been postponed. It was the only
thing to do at the moment. Of course there will
be newspaper men. We&#8217;ll have to make up a
story&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll do nothing of the kind. Tell them the
truth, Uncle Fred. That I&#8217;m not&mdash;wanted. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
I was kept&mdash;waiting&mdash;at the church. Like the
heroine in a movie.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood on the steps above him, looking down.
She was as white as her dress.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to see anybody. I don&#8217;t mind losing
Del. He doesn&#8217;t count. He isn&#8217;t worth it.
But can you imagine that any man&mdash;<i>any</i> man,
Uncle Fred, could have kept <i>me</i>&mdash;waiting?&#8221;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />

<small>THE UGLY DUCKLING</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> thing that Frederick Towne got out of his
niece&#8217;s flight was this. &#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t let anybody
sympathize with her. Simply locked the door
of her room, and in the morning she was gone. It
has added immeasurably to the gossip.&#8221;</p>

<p>His listeners had, however, weighed him in the
balance of understanding and sympathy, and had
found him wanting. The youth in them sided with
Edith. But none of this showed in their manner.
They were polite and hospitable to the last. Frederick,
ushered out into the storm by Baldy, still
saw Jane like a bird, warm in her nest.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; Baldy said to his sister, when he
came back, &#8220;how he messed things up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane nodded. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Unemotional</i>&#8221;&mdash;Baldy&#8217;s voice seemed to call on
all the gods to listen, &#8220;you should see her eyes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s rather an old dear,&#8221; said Jane, and
having thus disposed airily of the great Frederick
Towne, she went about the house setting things to
right for the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Merrymaid&#8217;s out,&#8221; she told her brother; &#8220;you&#8217;d
better get her.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>He opened the door and the storm seemed to
whirl in upon him. He called the old cat and was
presently aware, as he stood on the porch, that she
danced about him in the dark. He chased her
blindly, and at last got his hands on her. She was
wet to the thighs, where she had waded in the
drifts, but galvanized like a small electric motor by
the intense chill of the night.</p>

<p>The wind shrieked and seemed to shake the
world. Before Baldy entered the house he turned
and faced the night&mdash;&#8220;<i>Edith</i>&#8221; was his voiceless
cry, &#8220;<i>Edith&mdash;Edith&mdash;&mdash;</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>By morning the violence of the storm had spent
itself. But it was still bitterly cold. The snow
was blue beneath the leaden sky. The chickens,
denied their accustomed promenade, ate and drank
and went to sleep again in the strange dusk.
Merrymaid and the kitten having poked their noses
into the frigid atmosphere withdrew to the snug
haven of a basket beneath the kitchen stove. Sophy
sent word that her rheumatism was worse, and that
she could not come over. Jane, surveying the accumulated
piles of dishes, felt a sense of unusual
depression. While Frederick Towne had talked
last night she had caught a glimpse of his world&mdash;the
great house&mdash;six servants&mdash;gay girls in the
glamour of good clothes, young men who matched
the girls, money to meet every emergency&mdash;a world
in which nobody had to wash dishes&mdash;or make soup
out of Sunday&#8217;s roast.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>She was cheered a bit, however, by the announcement
that her brother had decided to stay home
from the office.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have a try at that magazine cover&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her spirits rose. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be utterly perfect
if you got the prize&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much chance. The thing I need is a good
model&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I won&#8217;t do?&#8221; with some wistfulness.</p>

<p>They had talked of it before. Baldy refused to
see possibilities in Jane. &#8220;Since you bobbed your
hair, you&#8217;re too modern&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She was, rather,
medieval, with her straight-cut frocks and her
straight-cut locks. But she was a figure so familiar
that she failed to appeal to his imagination.</p>

<p>&#8220;Editors like &#8217;em modern, don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>But his thoughts had winged themselves to that
other woman whom his fancy painted in a thousand
poses.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Edith Towne were here&mdash;I&#8217;d put her on a
marble bench beside a sapphire sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you couldn&#8217;t get an editor in the world
to look at it. Sapphire seas and classic ladies are
a million years behind the times&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are never behind the times&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane shrugged, and changed the subject. &#8220;Darling&mdash;if
you&#8217;ll put your mind to mundane things
for a moment. To-morrow is Thanksgiving Day,
the Follettes are to dine with us, and we haven&#8217;t
any turkey.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>&#8220;Why haven&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were to get it when you went to town, and
now you&#8217;re not going&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am <i>not</i>&mdash;not for all the turkeys in the world.
We can have roast chickens. That&#8217;s simple enough,
Janey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may seem simple to you. But who&#8217;s going
to cut off their heads?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sophy,&#8221; said Baldy. Having killed Germans
in France he refused further slaughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sophy has the rheumatism&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, we can feast our souls&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Young
Baldwin&#8217;s mood was one of exaltation.</p>

<p>Jane leaned back in her chair and looked at him.
&#8220;Your perfectly poetic solution may satisfy you,
but it won&#8217;t feed the Follettes.&#8221;</p>

<p>With some irritation, therefore, he promised, if
all else failed, to himself decapitate the fowls.
&#8220;But your mind, Jane, never soars above
food&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane, with her chin in her hands, considered
this. &#8220;A woman,&#8221; she said, &#8220;who keeps house for
a poet&mdash;must anchor herself to&mdash;something. Perhaps
I&#8217;m like a captive balloon&mdash;if you cut the
cable, I&#8217;ll shoot straight up to the skies&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She liked that thought of herself, and smiled
over it, after Baldy had left her. She wondered
if the cable would ever be cut. If the captive balloon
would ever soar.</p>

<p>So she went about her simple tasks, putting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
bone on to boil for soup, preparing the vegetables
for it&mdash;wondering what she would have for dessert&mdash;with
all his scorn of domestic details, Baldy was
apt to be fastidious about his sweets&mdash;and coming
finally to her sweeping and dusting in the front
part of the house.</p>

<p>The telephone rang and she answered it. Evans
was at the other end of the wire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother wants to speak to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Follette asked if she might change her plans
for Thanksgiving. &#8220;Will you and your brother
dine with us, instead of our coming to you? Our
New York cousins find that they have the day free,
unexpectedly. They had been asked to a house
party in Virginia, but their hostess has had to postpone
it on account of illness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it going to be very grand? I haven&#8217;t a thing
to wear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be foolish, Jane. You always look like
a lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mrs. Follette.&#8221; Jane hoped that
she didn&#8217;t look as some ladies look. But there
were, of course, others. It was well for her at the
moment, that Mrs. Follette could not see her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I thought,&#8221; went on the unconscious
matron, &#8220;that if you were not too busy, you might
go with Evans to the grove and get some greens.
I&#8217;d like the house to look attractive. Is the snow
too deep?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit. When will he come?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>&#8220;You&#8217;d better arrange with him. Here he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Evans&#8217; voice was the only unchanged thing about
him. The sound of it at long distance always
brought the old days back to Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;After lunch?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me time to dress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>When luncheon was over, Jane went up-stairs to
get into out-of-door clothes. At the foot of the
stairs she had a glimpse of herself in the hall
mirror. She wore a one-piece lilac cotton frock&mdash;with
a small square apron, and an infinitesimal
bib. It was a nice-looking little frock, but she had
had it for a million years. That was the way with
all her clothes. The suit she was going to put on
had been dyed. It had been white in its first incarnation.
It was now brown. There was no telling
its chromatic future.</p>

<p>She heard steps on the porch, and turned to open
the door for Evans.</p>

<p>But it was not Evans. Briggs, Frederick
Towne&#8217;s chauffeur, stood there with a box in his
arms. &#8220;Mr. Towne&#8217;s compliments,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
shall I set it in the hall?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, thank you.&#8221; Her surprise brought the
quick color to her cheeks. She watched him go
back down the terrace, and enter the car, then she
opened the box.</p>

<p>Beneath clouds of white tissue paper she came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
upon a long, low basket, heaped with grapes and
tangerines, peaches and pomegranates. Tucked in
between the fruits were shelled nuts in fluted paper
cases, gleaming sweets in small glass jars, candied
pineapples and cherries, bunches of fat raisins,
stuffed dates and prunes.</p>

<p>Jane talked to the empty air. &#8220;How dear of
him&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The white tissue paper fell in drifts about her
as she lifted the basket from the box.</p>

<p>There was a little note tied to the handle.
Towne&#8217;s personal paper was thick and white. Jane
was aware of its expensiveness and it thrilled her.
His script was heavy and black&mdash;the note had,
unquestionably, an air.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Barnes</span>:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you how much I enjoyed your
hospitality last night&mdash;and you were good to listen
to me with so much sympathy. I am hoping that
you&#8217;ll let me come again and talk about Edith.
May I? And here&#8217;s a bit of color for your Thanksgiving
feast.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gap">&#8220;Gratefully always,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Frederick Towne</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Jane stood staring down at the friendly words.
It didn&#8217;t seem within reason that Frederick Towne
meant that he wanted to come&mdash;to see her. And
she really hadn&#8217;t listened with sympathy. But&mdash;oh,
of course, he could come. And it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
heavenly to have a thing like this happen on a day
like this.</p>

<p>As she straightened up with the basket in her
hands, she saw herself again in the long mirror&mdash;a
slender figure in green&mdash;bobbed black hair&mdash;golden
and purple fruits. She gasped and gazed again.
There was Baldy&#8217;s picture ready to his hand&mdash;November!
Against a background of gray&mdash;that
glowing figure&mdash;Baldy could idealize her&mdash;make
the wind blow her skirts a bit&mdash;give her a fluttering
ribbon or two, a glorified loveliness.</p>

<p>She sought him in his studio. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got something
to show you, darling-dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was moody. &#8220;Don&#8217;t interrupt me, Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rumpled up his hair, which he hated. &#8220;Mr.
Towne sent us some fruit, Baldy, and this.&#8221; She
held out the note to him.</p>

<p>He read it. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t say a word about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; her eyes were dancing;
&#8220;Baldy, it&#8217;s your little sister, Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t do a thing but sit there and
knit&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he liked to see me&mdash;knitting&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Baldy passed this over in puzzled silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the fruit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go in with you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He felt out
of sorts, discouraged. The morning had been
spent in sketching vague outlines&mdash;a sweep of fair
hair under a blue hat&mdash;detached feet in shoes with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
shining buckles&mdash;a bag that hung in the air without
hands. At intervals he had stood up and looked
out at the blank snow and the dull sky. The room
was warm enough, but he shivered. He suffered
vicariously for Edith Towne. He had hoped that
she might telephone. He had stayed home really
for that.</p>

<p>His studio was in the garage and was heated by
a little round stove. Jane said the garage reminded
her of the Boffins&#8217; parlor&mdash;a dead line was
drawn between art and utility. Baldy&#8217;s rug and
old couch and paints and brushes flung a challenge
as it were to the little Ford, the lawn mower, the
garden hose and the gasoline cans.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have spent three hours doing nothing,&#8221; he
said, as he shut the door behind him; &#8220;not much
encouragement in that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a model for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He followed her in, full of curiosity.</p>

<p>She showed him the fruit, then picked up the
basket. &#8220;Look in the mirror, not at me,&#8221; she commanded.</p>

<p>Reflected there in the clear glass, so still that
she seemed fixed in paint, Baldy really gave for the
first time an artist&#8217;s eye to the possibilities of his
little sister. In the midst of all that crashing
color&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>&#8220;Gosh,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;you&#8217;re good-looking!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>His air of utter astonishment was too much for
Jane. She set the basket on the steps, and laughed
until she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anything funny,&#8221; he told her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you wouldn&#8217;t, darling.&#8221;</p>

<p>She wiped her eyes with her little handkerchief,
and sat up. &#8220;I am just dropping a tear for the
ugly duckling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I made you feel like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their lighted-up eyes met, and suddenly he
leaned down and touched her cheek&mdash;a swift caress.
&#8220;You&#8217;re a little bit of all right, Janey,&#8221; which was
great praise from Baldy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>&#8220;STAY IN THE FIELD, OH, WARRIOR!&#8221;</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Follette</span> had been born in Maryland with
a tradition of aristocratic blood. It was this tradition
which had upheld her through years of
poverty after the Civil War. A close scanning of
the family tree might have disclosed ancestors who
had worked with their hands. But these, Mrs. Follette&#8217;s
family had chosen to ignore in favor of one
grandfather who had held Colonial office, and who
had since been magnified into a personage.</p>

<p>On such slight foundation, Mrs. Follette had
erected high towers of social importance. As a
wife of a government clerk, her income was limited,
but she lived on a farm, back of Sherwood
Park, which she had inherited from her father.
The farm was called Castle Manor, which dignified
it in the eyes of the county. Mrs. Follette&#8217;s friends
were among the old families who had occupied the
land for many generations. She would have nothing
to do with the people of Sherwood Park. She
held that all suburbs are negligible socially. People
came to them from anywhere and went from
them to be swallowed up in obscurity. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
no stability. She made an exception, only, of the
Baldwin Barneses. There was good Maryland
blood back of them, and more than that, a Virginia
Governor. To be sure they did not care for these
things; old Baldwin&#8217;s democracy had been almost
appalling. But they were, none the less, worth
while.</p>

<p>Mr. Follette, during his lifetime, had walked a
mile each morning to take the train at Sherwood
Park, and had walked back a mile each night, until
at last he had tired of two peripatetic miles a day,
and of eight hours at his desk, and of eternally putting
on his dinner coat when there was no one to
see, and like old Baldwin Barnes, he had laid him
down with a will.</p>

<p>At his death all income stopped, and Mrs. Follette
had found herself on a somewhat lonely peak
of exclusiveness. She could not afford to go with
her richer neighbors, and she refused to consider
Sherwood seriously. Now and then, however, she
accepted invitations from old friends, and in return
offered such simple hospitality as she could
afford without self-consciousness. She might be a
snob, but she was, to those whom she permitted to
cross her threshold, an incomparable hostess. She
gave what she had without apology.</p>

<p>She had, too, a sort of admirable courage. Her
ambitions had been wrapped up in her son. What
her father might have been, Evans was to be.
They had scrimped and saved that he might go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
college and study law. Then, at that first dreadful
cry from across the seas, he had gone. There had
been long months of fighting. He had left her in
the flower of his youth, a wonder-lad, with none to
match him among his friends. He had come back
crushed and broken. He, whose career lay so close
to his heart&mdash;could do now no sustained work.
Mentally and physically he must rest. He might
be years in getting back. He would never get back
to gay and gallant boyhood. That was gone forever.</p>

<p>Yet if Mrs. Follette&#8217;s heart had failed her at
times, she had never shown it. She was making the
farm pay for itself. She supplied the people of
Sherwood Park and surrounding estates with milk.
But she never was in any sense&mdash;a milkwoman. It
was, rather, as if in selling her milk she distributed
favors. It was on this income that she subsisted,
she and her son.</p>

<p>It was because of Mrs. Follette&#8217;s social complexes
that Jane had been forced to limit her invitations
for the Thanksgiving dinner. She would
have preferred more people to liven things up for
Evans and Baldy, but Mrs. Follette&#8217;s prejudices
had to be considered.</p>

<p>Evans, democratic, like his father, laughed at his
mother&#8217;s assumptions. But he rarely in these days
set himself against her. It involved always a contest,
and he was tired of fighting.</p>

<p>That was why he had asked Jane to help him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
in the stand he had taken against the New York
trip. He felt that he could never hold out against
his mother&#8217;s arguments.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;d keep eternally at it, and I&#8217;d have to give
in,&#8221; he told himself with the irritability which was
so new to him and so surprising. As a boy he had
been good-tempered even in moments of disagreement
with his mother.</p>

<p>Going down to luncheon, he hoped the subject
would not come up. The afternoon was before him,
and Jane. He wanted no cloud to mar it.</p>

<p>On the steps he passed Mary, his mother&#8217;s maid,
making the house immaculate for the guests of to-morrow.
She was singing an old song, linking herself
musically with the black men of generations
back. Mary was over sixty, and her voice was thin
and piping. Yet there was, after all, a sort of fierce
power in that thin and piping voice.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Stay in the fiel&#8217;,</div>
<div class="verse">Stay in the fiel&#8217;, oh, wah-yah&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Stay in the fiel&#8217;</div>
<div class="verse">Till the wah is ended.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Again Evans felt that sense of unaccountable irritation.
He wished that Mary wouldn&#8217;t sing....</p>

<p>Later as he and Jane swung along together in
the clear cold Jane said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve such a lot to tell you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She told it in her whimsical way&mdash;Baldy&#8217;s adventure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Frederick Towne&#8217;s visit, the basket of
fruit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Baldy is simply mad about Edith Towne. He
hasn&#8217;t been able to talk of anything else. Of course,
he&#8217;ll have to get over it but he isn&#8217;t looking ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should he get over it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her chin went up. &#8220;He&#8217;s a clerk in the departments,
and she a&mdash;plutocrat&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps she won&#8217;t look at it like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but she has <i>men</i> at her feet. And Baldy&#8217;s
a boy. Evans, if I had lovely dresses &#8217;n&#8217; everything,
I&#8217;d have men at my feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should you want them at your feet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every woman does. We want to grind &#8217;em
under our heels,&#8221; she stamped in the snow to show
him; &#8220;but Baldy and I are a pair of Cinderellas,
minus&mdash;godmothers&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She was in a gay mood. She was wrapped in
her old orange cape, and the sun, breaking the bank
of sullen clouds in the west, seemed to turn her
lithe young body into flame.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you <i>love</i> a day like this, Evans?&#8221; She
pressed forward up the hill with all her strength.
Evans followed, panting. At the top they sat down
for a moment on an old log&mdash;which faced the long
aisles of snow between thin black trees. The vista
was clear-cut and almost artificial in its restraint
of color and its wide bare spaces.</p>

<p>Evans&#8217; little dog, Rusty, ran back and forth&mdash;following
this trail and that. Finally in pursuit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
a rabbit, he was led far afield. They heard him
barking madly in the distance. It was the only
sound in the stillness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane,&#8221; Evans said, &#8220;do you remember the last
time we were here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; The light went out of her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I look back it was heaven, Jane. I&#8217;d give
anything on God&#8217;s earth if I was where I was
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the blood was drained from her face.
&#8220;Evans, you wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; passionately, &#8220;you
wouldn&#8217;t give up those three years in France&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat very still. Then he said tensely, &#8220;No, I
wouldn&#8217;t, even though it has made me lose you&mdash;Jane&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t say such things&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must. Don&#8217;t I know? You were such an
unawakened little thing, my dear. But I could
have&mdash;waked you. And I can&#8217;t wake you now.
That&#8217;s my tragedy. You&#8217;ll never wake up&mdash;for
me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s true. Why not say it? I&#8217;ve come
back a&mdash;scarecrow, the shadow of a man. And
you&#8217;re just where I left you&mdash;only lovelier&mdash;more
of a woman&mdash;more to be worshipped&mdash;Jane&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>As he caught her hand up in his, she had a sudden
flashing vision of him as he had been when he
last sat with her in the grove&mdash;the swing of his
strong figure, his bare head borrowing gold from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the sun&mdash;the touch of assurance which had been
so compelling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never knew that you cared&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it, but not as I did after your wonderful
letters to me over there. I felt, if I ever came
back, I&#8217;d move heaven and earth.&#8221; He stopped.
&#8220;But I came back&mdash;different. And I haven&#8217;t any
right to say these things to you. I&#8217;m not going to
say them&mdash;Jane. It might spoil our&mdash;friendship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing can spoil our friendship, Evans&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He laid his hand on hers. &#8220;Then you are
mine&mdash;until somebody comes along and claims
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t anybody else,&#8221; she turned her
fingers up to meet his, &#8220;so don&#8217;t worry, old dear,&#8221;
she smiled at him but her lashes were wet. Her
hand was warm in his and she let it stay there, and
after a while she said, &#8220;I have sometimes thought
that if it would make you happy, I might&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Might&mdash;love me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t say it for that. I
just had to have the truth between us. And I don&#8217;t
want&mdash;pity. If&mdash;if I ever get back&mdash;I&#8217;ll make you
love me, Jane.&#8221; There was a hint of his old masterfulness&mdash;and
she was thrilled by it.</p>

<p>She withdrew her hand and stood up. &#8220;Then
I&#8217;ll&mdash;pray&mdash;that you&mdash;get back&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean it, Janey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean it, Evans.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>&#8220;Then pray good and hard, my dear, for I&#8217;m going
to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They smiled at each other, but it was a sacred
moment.</p>

<p>The things they did after that were rendered unimportant
by the haze of enchantment which hung
over Evans&#8217; revelation. No man can tell a woman
that he loves her, no woman can listen, without a
throbbing sense of the magnitude of the thing
which has happened. From such beginnings is
written the history of humanity.</p>

<p>Deep in a hollow where the wind had swept up
the snow, and left the ground bare they found
crowfoot in an emerald carpet&mdash;there were holly
branches dripping red berries like blood on the
white drifts. They filled their arms, and at last
they were ready to go.</p>

<p>Evans whistled for Rusty but the little dog did
not come. &#8220;He&#8217;ll find us; he knows every inch of
the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Rusty did not find them, and they were
on the ridge when that first awful cry came to
them.</p>

<p>Jane clutched Evans. &#8220;What is it&mdash;oh, what <i>is</i>
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>He swallowed twice before he could speak. &#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;Rusty&mdash;one
of those steel traps&#8221;&mdash;he was panting
now&mdash;his forehead wet&mdash;&#8220;the negroes put them
around for rabbits&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Again that frenzied cry
broke the stillness. &#8220;They&#8217;re hellish things&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>Jane began to run in the direction of the sound.
&#8220;Come on, Evans&mdash;oh, come quick&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stumbled after her. At last he caught at her
dress and held her. &#8220;If he&#8217;s hurt I can&#8217;t stand
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was dreadful to see him. Jane felt as if
clutched by a nightmare. &#8220;Stay here, and don&#8217;t
worry. I&#8217;ll get him out&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a cruel thing to face. There was blood
and that little trembling body. The cry reduced
now to an agonized whimpering. How she opened
the trap she never knew, but she did open it, and
made a bandage from her blouse which she tore
from her shoulders regardless of the cold. And
after what seemed to be ages, she staggered back to
Evans with her dreadful burden wrapped in her
cape. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get him to a veterinary. Run
down to the road and see if there&#8217;s a car in
sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a car, and when Evans stopped it, two
men came charging up the bank. Jane gave the dog
into the arms of one of them. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to go
with them, Evans,&#8221; she said and wrapped herself
more closely in her cape. &#8220;There are several doctors
at Rockville. You&#8217;d better ask the station-master
about the veterinary.&#8221;</p>

<p>After they had gone, she stood there on the ridge
and watched the car out of sight. She felt stunned
and hysterical. It had been awful to see Rusty, but
the most awful thing was that vision of Evans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
stumbling through the snow. A broken body is for
tears&mdash;a broken spirit is beyond tears.</p>

<p>She shuddered and pressed her hands against her
eyes. Then she went down the hill and across the
road in the darkening twilight. She crept into the
house. Baldy must not see her; there was blood on
her cape and her clothes were torn, and Baldy
would ask questions, and he would call Evans a&mdash;coward....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was late when Evans came to Castle Manor
with his dog in his arms. Rusty was comfortable
and he had wagged a grateful tail. The pain had
gone out of his eyes and the veterinary had said
that in a few days the wound would heal. There
were no vital parts affected&mdash;and he would give
some medicine which would prevent further suffering.</p>

<p>Mrs. Follette was out, and old Mary was in the
kitchen, singing. She stopped her song as Evans
came through. He asked her to help him and she
brought a square, deep basket and made Rusty a
bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You-all jes&#8217; put him heah by the fiah, and I&#8217;ll
look atter him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Evans shook his head. &#8220;I want him in my room.
I&#8217;ll take care of him in the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>He carried the dog up-stairs with him, knelt beside
him, drew hard deep breaths as the little fellow
licked his hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>&#8220;What kind of a man am I?&#8221; Evans said sharply
in the silence. &#8220;God, what kind of a man?&#8221;</p>

<p>Through the still house came old Mary&#8217;s thin and
piping song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Stay in the fiel&#8217;,</div>
<div class="verse">Stay in the fiel&#8217;, oh, wah-yah&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Stay in the fiel&#8217;</div>
<div class="verse">Till the wah is ended.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Evans got up and shut the door....</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>A FAMISHED PILGRIM</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span> was waked usually by the hoarse crow of
an audacious little rooster, who sent his challenge
to the rising sun.</p>

<p>But on Thanksgiving morning, she found herself
sitting up in bed in the deep darkness&mdash;slim
and white and shivering&mdash;oppressed by some phantom
of the night.</p>

<p>She came to it gradually. The strange events of
yesterday. Evans. Her own share in his future.</p>

<p>Her room was icy. She climbed out of bed, and
closed the windows, lighted the lamp on her little
table, wrapped herself in a warm robe, and sat up
among her pillows, to think the thing out.</p>

<p>The lamp had a yellow shade, and shone like a
full moon among the shadows. Jane, just beyond
the circle of light, was a spectral figure with her
black hair and the faint blue of her gown.</p>

<p>Her own share in Evans&#8217; future? Had she really
linked her life with his? She had promised to pray
that he might get back&mdash;she had pledged youth,
hope and constancy to his cause. And she had
promised before she had seen that stumbling figure
in the snow!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>In the matters of romance, Jane&#8217;s thoughts had
always ventured. She had dreamed of a gallant
lover, a composite hero, one who should combine the
reckless courage of a Robin Hood with the high
moralities of a Galahad. With such a lover one
might gallop through life to a piping tune. Or if
the Galahad predominated in her hero, to an inspiring
processional!</p>

<p>And here was Evans, gray and gaunt, shaken by
tremors, fitting himself into the background of her
future. And she didn&#8217;t want him there. Oh, not
as he had been out there in the snow!</p>

<p>Yet she was sorry for him with a sympathy that
wrung her heart. She couldn&#8217;t hurt him. She
wouldn&#8217;t. Was there no way out of it?</p>

<p>Her hands went up to her face. She had a simple
and childlike faith. &#8220;Oh, God,&#8221; she prayed,
&#8220;make us all&mdash;happy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her cheeks were wet as she lay back on her pillows.
And a certain serenity followed her little
prayer. Things would work together in some way
for good.... She would let it rest at that.</p>

<p>When at last the rooster crowed, Jane cast off
the covers and went to the windows, drawing back
the curtains. There was a faint whiteness in the
eastern sky&mdash;amethyst and pearl, aquamarine, the
day had dawned!</p>

<p>Well, after all, wasn&#8217;t every day a new world?
And this day of all days. One must think about
the thankful things!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>She discussed that with Baldy at the breakfast
table.</p>

<p>Baldy scoffed. &#8220;I&#8217;m not a hypocrite. It has
been a rotten year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, money isn&#8217;t everything, and we have each
other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Money is a lot. And just because we haven&#8217;t
all been killed off is no special reason why we
should thank the Lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Baldy, I want to thank him for the little
things. Our little house, and warmth and light,
and you, coming home at night&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear child, we don&#8217;t own the house, and I&#8217;m
really not much when I get here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t true, Baldy. And aren&#8217;t you thankful
that you have me?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a quaver in her voice, and he was not
hard-hearted. Neither was he in a mood for sentiment.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, old dear? Want me to
throw bouquets at you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do. I&#8217;m low in my mind this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw that she meant it. &#8220;Anything happened,
Janey?&#8221; he asked in a different tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing to talk about. But&mdash;I wish I had
a shoulder to weep on, Baldy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Weep on mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &#8220;No. You&#8217;d be about as
comforting as a wooden Indian.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like that,&#8221; hotly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>&#8220;Your intentions are good. But your mind isn&#8217;t
on me. It&#8217;s on Edith Towne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you think that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ve one ear cocked towards the telephone&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He flushed. &#8220;Well, who wouldn&#8217;t? I want to
hear from her.&#8221;</p>

<p>He wanted to hear so much that he did not go to
church lest he miss her call. But Jane went, and
sat in the Barnes&#8217; pew, and was thankful, as she
had said, for love and warmth and light.</p>

<p>Throughout the sermon, she stared at the stained
glass window which was just above the Follette
pew. It was a memorial to two lads who had lost
their lives in France. The window showed the
young heroes as shining knights&mdash;and that was the
way people thought about them. They had been,
really, rather commonplace fellows. But death had
transfigured them. They would remain always in
the eyes of this world as young and splendid.</p>

<p>And there beneath them sat this morning a man
who had, too, been young and splendid. But who
was wrapped in no shining armor of illusion. He
had come back a hero, but had been among them
long enough to lose his halo. It was manifestly
unfair. Jane resolved that she would keep in her
heart always that vision of Evans as a shining
knight. Whoever else forgot, she would not forget.</p>

<p>Evans, with his mother in the pew, looked
straight ahead of him. He seemed worn and weary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
&mdash;a dark shadow set against the brightness of those
comrades on the glowing glass.</p>

<p>After church, he waited in the aisle for Jane.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll walk down with you. Mother is going to ride
with Dr. Hallam.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked a little way in silence, then he said,
&#8220;Rusty is comfortable this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mother told me over the telephone.&#8221;</p>

<p>He limped along at her side. &#8220;Jane, I didn&#8217;t
sleep last night&mdash;thinking about it. It is a thing
I can&#8217;t understand. A dreadful thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand. You love Rusty. It was because
you love him so much&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But to let a woman do it. Jane, do you remember&mdash;years
ago? That mad dog?&#8221;</p>

<p>She did remember. Evans had killed it in the
road to save a child. It had been a horrible experience,
but not for a moment had he hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t afraid then, Janey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This was different. You couldn&#8217;t see the thing
you loved hurt. It wasn&#8217;t fear. It was affection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t gloss it over. I know what you felt.
I saw it in your eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Saw what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Contempt.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned on him. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t. Perhaps, just
at first. I didn&#8217;t understand....&#8221; She fought
for self-control, but in spite of it, the tears rolled
down her cheeks.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, Janey, don&#8217;t.&#8221; He was in an agony of
remorse. &#8220;I&#8217;ve made you cry.&#8221;</p>

<p>She blinked away the tears. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t contempt,
Evans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it should have been. Why not? No man
who calls himself a man would have let you do
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had come to the path under the pines, and
were alone in that still world. Jane tucked her
hand in the crook of Evans&#8217; arm. &#8220;Dear boy, stop
thinking about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall never stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to promise me that you&#8217;ll try.
Evans, you know we are going to fight it out together....&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes did not meet hers. &#8220;Do you think I&#8217;d
let you? Well, you think wrong.&#8221; He began to
walk rapidly, so that it was hard to keep pace with
him. &#8220;I&#8217;m not worth it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now quite as suddenly as she had cried, she
laughed, and the laugh had a break in it. &#8220;You&#8217;re
worth everything that America has to give you.&#8221;
She told him of the things she had thought of in
church. &#8220;You are as much of a hero as any of
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head. &#8220;All that hero stuff is dead
and gone, my dear. We idealize the dead, but not
the living.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was true and she knew it. But she did not
want to admit it. &#8220;Evans,&#8221; she said, and laid her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
cheek for a moment against the rough sleeve of his
coat, &#8220;don&#8217;t make me unhappy. Let me help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what you are asking. You&#8217;d
grow tired of it. Any woman would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why look ahead? Can&#8217;t we live for each day?&#8221;</p>

<p>She had lighted a flame of hope in him. &#8220;If I
might&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? Begin right now. What are you
thankful for, Evans?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you three things. Books and
your mother and me. Say that over&mdash;out loud.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tried to enter into her mood. &#8220;Books and
my mother and Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>She caught at another thought. &#8220;It almost
rhymes with Stevenson&#8217;s &#8216;books and food and summer
rain,&#8217; doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. What a man he was&mdash;cheerful in the face
of death. Jane, I believe I could face death more
cheerfully than life&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say such things&#8221;&mdash;they had come to the
little house on the terrace, &#8220;don&#8217;t say such things.
Don&#8217;t think them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a man thinks&mdash;&mdash; Do you believe it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe some of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk about it to-night. No, I can&#8217;t come
in. Dinner is at seven.&#8221; He lingered a moment
longer. &#8220;Do you know what a darling you are,
Jane?&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood watching him as he limped away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Once he turned and waved. She waved back and
her eyes were blurred with tears.</p>

<p>In Jane&#8217;s next letter to Judy she told about the
dinner.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know what to wear. But Baldy insisted
on my old white. In his present mid-Victorian
mood he would like me in &#8216;book-muslin,&#8217;
if things were made of it. It is a wispy rag of
chiffon, and I was hard up for slippers, so Baldy
painted a pair of gray suede with silver paint, and
I made a flat band of silver leaves for my hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;The effect wasn&#8217;t bad, even Baldy admitted it,
and Evans quoted Shelley&mdash;something about &#8216;an
orbed maiden with white fire laden.&#8217; Evans and
Baldy are having a perfect orgy of Keats and
Shelley. They soar over our heads. They hate
realism and pessimism&mdash;they say it is a canker at
the heart of civilization. That all healthy nations
are idealistic and optimistic. It is only when countries
are senile that they grow cynical and sour.
You should hear them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had a delicious dinner. It seems to me,
Judy, that my mind dwells a great deal on things
to eat. But, after all, why shouldn&#8217;t I? Housekeeping
is my job.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Follette doesn&#8217;t attempt to do anything
that she can&#8217;t do well, and it was all so simple and
satisfying. In the center of the table was some of
the fruit that Mr. Towne sent in a silver epergne,
and there were four Sheffield candlesticks with
white candles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Follette carved the turkey. Evans can&#8217;t
do things like that&mdash;she wore her perennial black
lace and pearls, and in spite of everything, Judy, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
can&#8217;t help liking her, though she is such a beggar
on horseback. They haven&#8217;t a cent, except what
she makes from the milk, but she looks absolutely
the lady of the manor.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cousins are very fashionable. One of them,
Muriel Follette, knows Edith Towne intimately.
She told us all about the wedding, and how people
are blaming Edith for running away and are feeling
terribly sorry for Mr. Towne. Of course they
didn&#8217;t know that Baldy and I had ever laid eyes
on either of them. But you should have seen
Baldy&#8217;s eyes, when Muriel said things about Edith.
I was scared stiff for fear he&#8217;d say something. You
know how his temper flares.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Muriel said some catty things. That
everybody is sure that Delafield Simms is in love
with someone else, and that they are saying Edith
might have known it if she hadn&#8217;t always looked
upon herself as the center of the universe. And
they feel that if her heart is broken, the decent
thing would be to mourn in the bosom of her family.
Of course I&#8217;m not quoting her exact words,
but you&#8217;ll get the idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Baldy thinks his queen can do no wrong,
and was almost <i>bursting</i>. Judy, he walks in a
dream. I don&#8217;t know what good it is going to do
him to feel like that. He will have to always worship
at a distance like Dante. Or was it Abelard?
I always get those <i>grande passions</i> mixed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow, there you have it. Edith Towne rode
in Baldy&#8217;s Ford, and he has hitched that little
wagon to a star!</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, after dinner, we set the victrola going
and Baldy had to dance with Muriel. She dances
extremely well, and I know he enjoyed it, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
he wouldn&#8217;t admit it. And Muriel enjoyed it.
There&#8217;s no denying that Baldy has a way with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;After they had danced a while everybody played
bridge, except Evans and me. You know how I
hate it, and it makes Evans nervous. So we went
in the library and talked. Evans is dreadfully
discouraged about himself. I wish that you were
here and that we could talk it over. But it is hard
to do it at long distance. There ought to be some
way to help him. Sometimes it seems that I
can&#8217;t stand it when I remember what he used
to be.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Evans had carried Jane off to the library high-handedly.
&#8220;I want you,&#8221; was all the reason he
vouchsafed as they came into the shabby room with
its leaping flames in the fireplace, its book-lined
walls, its imposing portrait above the mantel.</p>

<p>The portrait showed Evans&#8217; grandfather, and beneath
it was a photograph of Evans himself. The
likeness between the two men was striking&mdash;there
was the same square set of the shoulders, the same
bright, waved hair, the same air of youth and high
spirits. The grandfather in the portrait wore a
blue uniform, the grandson was in khaki, but they
were, without a question, two of a kind.</p>

<p>&#8220;You belong here, Jane,&#8221; said Evans, &#8220;on
one side of the fireplace, with me on the other.
That&#8217;s the way I always see you when I shut my
eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see me now with your eyes wide
open&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>&#8220;Yes. Jane, I told Mother this afternoon that
I wouldn&#8217;t go to New York. So that&#8217;s settled, without
your saying anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How does she feel about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she still thinks that I should go. But I&#8217;ll
stay here,&#8221; he moved his head restlessly. &#8220;I want
to be where you are, Jane. And now, my dear,
we&#8217;re going to talk things out. You know that yesterday
you made a sort of&mdash;promise. That you&#8217;d
pray for me to get back&mdash;and that if I got back&mdash;well,
you&#8217;d give me a chance. Jane, I want your
prayers, but not your promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not fit to think of any woman. When I
am&mdash;well&mdash;if I ever am&mdash;you can do as you think
best. But you mustn&#8217;t be bound.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat silent, looking into the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that I&#8217;m right, don&#8217;t you, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do, Evans. I thought of it, too, last
night. And it seems like this to me. If we can
just be friends&mdash;without bothering with&mdash;anything
else&mdash;it will be easier, won&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you how gladly I&#8217;d bother, as you
call it. But it wouldn&#8217;t be fair. You are young,
and you have a right to happiness. I&#8217;d be a
shadow on your&mdash;future&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He dropped on the rug at her feet. &#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll
leave it at that. We&#8217;re friends, forever,&#8221; he reached
up and took her hands in his, &#8220;forever?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>&#8220;Always, Evans&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For better, for worse&mdash;for richer, for poorer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>They stared into the fire, and then he said softly,
&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s enough for me, my dear, that&#8217;s
enough for me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and after a while he began to
speak in broken sentences. &#8220;&#8216;Ah, silver shrine,
here will I take my rest.... After so many
hours of toil and quest.... A famished pilgrim....&#8217;
That&#8217;s Keats, my dear. Jane, do
you know that you are food and drink?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I?&#8221; unsteadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear little thing, if I had you always by
my fire I could fight the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Jane and Baldy reached home that night,
Baldy stamped up and down the house, saying
things about Muriel Follette. &#8220;A girl like that to
criticise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She danced well,&#8221; said Jane, who had taken
off the silver wreath, and had kicked off the silver
slippers, and was curled up in a big chair as comfortable
as a white cat.</p>

<p>&#8220;What right had she to say things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;People are saying them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did she have to repeat them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling Baldy, she didn&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Know what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How you felt about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped and stood in front of her. &#8220;How do
you know what I feel?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, well, you seem to have made yourself Miss
Towne&#8217;s champion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done nothing of the kind, Jane. But I
have a human interest in a fellow creature.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jane, &#8220;I have a human interest,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you ever serious, Janey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s better to laugh than to cry.&#8221; There was a
little catch in her voice.</p>

<p>Baldy wound the clock, and she watched
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What time is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twelve-thirty.&#8221;</p>

<p>She yawned. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The telephone rang, and Baldy was off like a
shot. Jane uncurled herself from her chair and
lent a listening ear. It was a moment of exciting
interest. Edith Towne was at the other end of the
wire!</p>

<p>Jane knew it by Baldy&#8217;s singing voice. He didn&#8217;t
talk like that to commonplace folk who called him
up. She was devoured with curiosity.</p>

<p>He came in, at last, literally walking on air.
And just as Jane had felt that his voice sang, so she
felt now that his feet danced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Janey, it was Edith Towne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did she say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just saw my advertisement. Paper delayed&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is she?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>&#8220;Beyond Alexandria. But we&#8217;re not to give it
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even to Mr. Towne?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. She&#8217;s asked me to bring her bag, and some
other things.&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw himself into a chair opposite Jane, one
leg over the arm of it. He was a careless and picturesque
figure. Even Jane was aware of his youth
and good looks.</p>

<p>Edith had, as it seemed, asked him to have Towne
send the ring back to Delafield&mdash;to have her wedding
presents sent back, to have a bag packed with
her belongings.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to take it to her on my car&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you a perfect stranger. I think it&#8217;s utterly
mad, Baldy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why mad? And she doesn&#8217;t feel that I&#8217;m a
perfect stranger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it is because I am a perfectly disinterested
person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not disinterested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you say that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you know, Baldy. You&#8217;re terribly smitten.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment his eyes blazed, then he swaggered.
&#8220;If I am, what then? I&#8217;d rather worship a woman
like that for the rest of my life than marry anybody
I&#8217;ve ever seen&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know a thing about her except that
she has lovely eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had risen, and as she stood in front of him
there was again that effect of two young cockerels
on the edge of an encounter. Then they were
saved by their sense of humor. &#8220;Oh, go to bed,&#8221;
young Baldwin told her; &#8220;you&#8217;re jealous, Janey.&#8221;</p>

<p>She started up the stairs but before she had
reached the landing he called after her. &#8220;Jane,
what have you on hand for to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>She leaned over the rail and looked down at him.
&#8220;Friday? Feed the chickens. Feed the cats.
Help Sophy clean the silver. Drink tea at four
with Mrs. Allison, and three other young things of
eighty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, look here. I don&#8217;t want to face Towne.
He&#8217;ll say things about Edith&mdash;and insist on her
coming back&mdash;she says he will, and that&#8217;s why she
won&#8217;t call him up. And you&#8217;ve got more diplomacy
than I have. You might make it all seem&mdash;reasonable.
Will you do it, Jane?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that you want me to call on him
at his office?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Go in with me in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Baldy, are you shirking? Or do you really
think me as wonderful as your words seem to imply?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if you&#8217;re going to put it like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled down at him. &#8220;Let&#8217;s leave it then
that I am&mdash;wonderful. But suppose Mr. Towne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
doesn&#8217;t fall for your plan? Perhaps he won&#8217;t let
her have the bag or a check-book or money or&mdash;anything&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane saw then a sudden and passionate change
in her brother. &#8220;If he doesn&#8217;t let her have it, I
will. I may be poor but I&#8217;ll beg or borrow rather
than have her brought back to face those&mdash;cats&mdash;until
she wants to come.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>JANE AS DEPUTY</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Frederick Towne</span> never arrived in his office until
ten o&#8217;clock. So Jane was ahead of him. She
sat in a luxurious outer room, waiting.</p>

<p>To the right was a great open space&mdash;with desks
boxed in by glass partitions. The wall paper was
green, so that the people at the desks had the effect
of fish in an aquarium. There was the constant
staccato tap of typewriters, and now and
then a girl got up, swam as it were, out of one of
the glass boxes and into another.</p>

<p>The girls were most of them well dressed. Much
better dressed than Jane who had on a cheap gray
suit and a soft little hat of the same color. One
of the girls, fair-haired and slender, was in the
nearest glass box. She wore a black serge frock
and a string of ivory beads. She looked to Jane
much more distinguished than any of the others.</p>

<p>When Frederick came in he saw Jane at once,
and held out his hand smiling. &#8220;You&#8217;ve heard
from Edith?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Last night. Too late to let you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. We&#8217;ll go into my room.&#8221; He led the
way, and Jane was at once aware of the effect of
his cordial manner upon the fish who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
swimming in and out of the aquarium. Between
the time of Frederick&#8217;s entrance and the moment
when he closed the door upon them, they seemed
to hang suspended. She supposed that after that
they swam again.</p>

<p>If the outer room had resembled an aquarium,
Frederick&#8217;s was like a forest&mdash;there was a plant or
two and more green paper&mdash;the shine of old mahogany&mdash;and
in one of the shadowy corners a
bronze elephant.</p>

<p>Jane was thrilled by a sense of things happening.
Outwardly calm, she was inwardly stirred by
excitement.</p>

<p>She sat in a big leather chair which nearly swallowed
her up, and stated her errand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Baldy thought I&#8217;d better come, he&#8217;s so busy,
and anyhow he thinks I have more tact.&#8221; She
tilted her chin at him and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you thought it needed tact.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t you, Mr. Towne? We really
haven&#8217;t a thing to do with it, and I&#8217;m sure you
think so. Only now we&#8217;re in it, we want to do the
best we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see. Since Edith has chosen you and your
brother as ambassadors, you&#8217;ve got to use diplomacy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t choose me, she chose Baldy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why can&#8217;t she deal directly with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She ran away from you. And she isn&#8217;t ready
to come back.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>&#8220;She ought to come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t think so. And she&#8217;s afraid you&#8217;ll
insist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does she want me to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Send her the bag with the money and the check-book,
and let Baldy take out a lot of things.
She gave him a list; there&#8217;s everything from toilet
water to talcum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose I refuse to send them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can, of course. But you won&#8217;t, will
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I suppose not. I shan&#8217;t coerce her. But
it&#8217;s rather a strange thing for her to be willing to
trust all this to your brother. She has seen him
only once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jane, with some spirit, &#8220;you&#8217;ve
seen Baldy only once, and wouldn&#8217;t you trust
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>She flung the challenge at him, and quite surprisingly
he found himself saying, &#8220;Yes, I would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jane, &#8220;of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair and looked at her.
Again he was aware of quickened emotions. She
revived half-forgotten ardors. Gave him back his
youth. She used none of the cut and dried methods
of sophistication. She was fearless, absolutely
alive, and in spite of her cheap gray suit, altogether
lovely.</p>

<p>So it was with an air of almost romantic challenge
that he said, &#8220;What would you advise?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;d let her alone, like little Bo-Peep. She&#8217;ll
come home before you know it, Mr. Towne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish that I could think it&mdash;however, it&#8217;s a
great comfort to know that she&#8217;s safe. I shall give
it out that she is visiting friends, and that I&#8217;ve
heard from her. And now, about the things she
wants. It seems absolutely silly to send them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s silly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, clothes make such a lot of difference to a
woman. I can absolutely change my feelings by
changing my frock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of feelings do you have when you
wear gray?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cool and comfortable ones&mdash;do you know the
delightful things that are gray? Pussy-willows,
and sea-gulls, and rainy days&mdash;and oh, a lot of
things&#8221;&mdash;she surveyed him thoughtfully, &#8220;and old
Sheffield, and&mdash;well, I can&#8217;t think of everything.&#8221;
She rose. &#8220;I&#8217;ll leave the list with you and you can
telephone Baldy when to come for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go. I want to talk to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not unless I want to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am. I have to go to market&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Briggs can take you over. I&#8217;ll call up the
garage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Briggs! Can you imagine Briggs driving
through the streets of Washington with a pound
of sausage and a three-rib roast?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>&#8220;Do you mean that you are going to take your
parcels back with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. There aren&#8217;t any deliveries in Sherwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated for a moment, then touched her
shoulder lightly with his forefinger. &#8220;Look here.
Let Briggs take you to market, then come back here,
and we&#8217;ll run up to the house, get the things for
lunch at Chevy Chase, and put you down, sausages,
bags and all, at your own door in Sherwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; She was all shining radiance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really. You&#8217;ll do it then? Sit down a moment
while I call up Briggs.&#8221;</p>

<p>He called the garage and turned again to Jane.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll dictate some important letters, and be ready
for you when you get back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane, being shown out finally by the elegant Frederick,
was again aware of the interest displayed by
the fish in the aquarium. She was also aware that
the girl in black serge with the white beads had
risen, and that Towne was saying, &#8220;When I come
back you can take my letters, Miss Logan.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went all the way down to the first floor of the
big building, and Jane and her cheap gray suit
were once more under observation, this time by
people on the sidewalk, as Briggs and Towne got
her into the car. She rode away in great state and
elegance. She was not quite sure whether she was
really Jane Barnes. It seemed much more likely
that she was Cinderella in a coach made out of a
pumpkin, and that Briggs had been metamorphosed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
from a rat. She leaned against the luxury of the
fawn-colored cushions, and overlooked the outside
world of pedestrians. Until to-day she had been
one of them, but now she rode above them&mdash;the
limousine was like some stately galleon breasting
the tides of traffic. Jane&#8217;s imagination carried her
far. Even when she came to the market the enchantment
persisted, especially when Briggs
proved to be perfectly human and helpful instead
of the automaton she had thought him. &#8220;If you
don&#8217;t mind my going in with you, Miss,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;I&#8217;d like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Jane went through the fine old market, with
its long aisles brilliant with the bounty of field and
garden, river, and bay and sea. There were red
meats and red tomatoes and red apples, oranges
that were yellow, and pumpkins a deeper orange.
There were shrimps that were pink, and red-snappers
a deeper rose. There was the gold of butter
and the gold of honey&mdash;the green of spinach, the
green of olives and the green of pickles in bowls of
brine, there was the brown of potatoes overflowing
in burlap bags, and the brown of bread baked to
crustiness&mdash;the brown of the plumage of dead
ducks&mdash;the white of onions and the white of roses.</p>

<p>Jane bought modestly and Briggs carried her
parcels. He even made a suggestion as to the cut
of the steak. His father, it seemed, had been a
butcher.</p>

<p>They drove back then for Frederick. Briggs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
went up for him, and returned to say that Mr.
Towne would be down in a moment.</p>

<p>Frederick was, as a matter of fact, finishing a
letter to Delafield Simms:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I am assuming that you will get your mail
at the Poinciana, but I shall also send a copy to
your New York office. Edith has asked me to return
the ring to you. I shall hold it until I learn
where it may be delivered into your hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;As for myself, I can only say this&mdash;that my first
impulse was to kill you. But perhaps I am too
civilized to believe that your death would make
things better. You must understand, of course,
that you&#8217;ve put yourself beyond the pale of decent
people.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Lucy&#8217;s pencil wavered&mdash;a flush stained her
throat and cheeks&mdash;then she wrote steadily, as
Frederick&#8217;s voice continued:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;You will find yourself blackballed by several of
the clubs. Whatever your motive, the world sees
no excuse.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>He stopped. &#8220;Will you read that over again,
Miss Logan?&#8221;</p>

<p>So Lucy read it&mdash;still with that hot flush on her
cheeks, and when she had finished Frederick said,
&#8220;You can lock the ring in the safe until I give you
further instructions.&#8221;</p>

<p>A clerk came in to say that the car was waiting,
and presently Frederick Towne went away and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Lucy was left alone in the great room, which was
not to her a forest of adventure, as it had seemed
to Jane, but a great prison where she tugged at her
chains.</p>

<p>She thought of Delafield Simms sailing fast to
southern waters. Of those purple seas&mdash;the blazing
stars in the splendid nights. Delafield had told
her of them. They had often talked together.</p>

<p>She turned the ring around on her finger, studying
the carved figure. The woman with the butterfly
wings was exquisite&mdash;but she did not know her
name. She slipped the ring on the third finger of
her left hand. Its diamonds blazed.</p>

<p>She locked it presently in the safe&mdash;then came
back and read the letter which Towne had signed.
She sealed it and stamped the envelope. Then she
wrote a letter of her own. She made a little ring
of her hair, and fastened it to the page. Beneath
it she wrote, &#8220;Lucy to Del&mdash;forever.&#8221; She kissed
the words, held the crackling sheet against her
heart. Her eyes were shining. The great room was
no longer a prison. She saw beyond captivity to
the open sea.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>THE SCARECROW</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Allison</span> and the three old ladies with whom
Jane was to drink tea, were neighbors. Mrs. Allison
lived alone, and the other three lived in the
homes of their several sons and daughters. They
played cards every Friday afternoon, and Jane always
came over when Mrs. Allison entertained and
helped her with the refreshments. They were very
simple and pleasant old ladies with a nice sense of
their own dignity. They resented deeply the fact
of Mrs. Follette&#8217;s social condescensions. The lady
of the manor spoke to them when she met them on
the street or in church, but she never invited them
to her house. She was, in effect, the chatelaine,
while they were merely Smith and Brown and Robinson!</p>

<p>Well, at any rate, they had Jane. Some of the
other young people scorned these elderly tea-parties,
and if they came, were apt to show it in their
manner. But Jane was never scornful. She always
had the time of her life, and the old ladies
felt particularly joyous and juvenile when she was
one of them.</p>

<p>But this afternoon Jane was late. Tea was always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
served promptly at four. And it happened
that there were popovers. So, of course, they
couldn&#8217;t wait.</p>

<p>&#8220;I telephoned to Sophy,&#8221; said Mrs. Allison,
&#8220;and Jane has gone to town. I suppose something
has kept her. Anyhow we&#8217;ll start in.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the old ladies ate the popovers and drank hot
sweet chocolate, and found them not as delectable
as when Jane was there to share them.</p>

<p>Things were, indeed, a bit dull. They discussed
Mrs. Follette, whose faults furnished a perpetual
topic. Mrs. Allison told them that the young Baldwins
had dined at Castle Manor on Thanksgiving.
And that there had been other guests.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can she afford it,&#8221; was the unanimous
opinion, &#8220;with that poor boy on her hands?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s hanging around now, waiting for Jane&#8217;s
train,&#8221; said Mrs. Allison, bringing in hot supplies
from the kitchen. &#8220;He met the noon train, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old ladies knew that Evans was in love with
Jane. He showed it, unmistakably. But they
hoped that Jane wouldn&#8217;t look at him. He was
dear and good, and had been wonderful once upon
a time. But that time had passed, and it was impossible
to consider Mrs. Follette as Jane&#8217;s mother-in-law!</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s sitting up there on the terrace,&#8221; Mrs. Allison
further informed them. &#8220;Do you think I&#8217;d
better ask him to come over?&#8221;</p>

<p>They thought she might, but her hospitable purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
was never fulfilled, for as she stepped out on
the porch, a long, low limousine stopped in front
of the house, and out of it came Jane in all the
glory of a great bunch of orchids, and with a man
by her side, whose elegance measured up to the
limousine and the lovely flowers.</p>

<p>They came up the path and Jane said, &#8220;Mrs.
Allison, may I present Mr. Towne, and will you
give him a cup of tea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, I will,&#8221; Mrs. Allison seemed to rise on
wings of gratification, &#8220;only it is chocolate and
not tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Frederick said that he adored chocolate, and
presently Mrs. Allison&#8217;s little living-room was all
in a pleasant flutter; and over on Jane&#8217;s terrace,
Evans Follette sat, a lonely sentinel, and pondered
on the limousine, and the elegance of Jane&#8217;s escort.</p>

<p>Once old Sophy called to him, &#8220;You&#8217;ll ketch your
death, Mr. Evans.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head and smiled at her. A man
who had lived through a winter in the trenches
thought nothing of this. Physical cold was easy
to endure. The cold that clutched at his heart was
the thing that frightened him.</p>

<p>The early night came on. There were lights now
in Mrs. Allison&#8217;s house, and within was warmth
and laughter. The old ladies, excited and eager,
told each other in flashing asides that Mr. Towne
was the <i>great</i> Frederick Towne. The one whose
name was so often in the papers, and his niece,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Edith, had been deserted at the altar. &#8220;You know,
my dear, the one who ran away.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Jane said that she must be getting home,
they pressed around her, sniffing her flowers, saying
pleasant things of her prettiness&mdash;hinting of
Towne&#8217;s absorption in her.</p>

<p>She laughed and sparkled. It was a joyous experience.
Mr. Towne had a way of making her
feel important. And the adulation of the old ladies
added to her elation.</p>

<p>As Frederick and Jane walked across the street
towards the little house on the terrace, a gaunt
figure rose from the top step and greeted them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Evans,&#8221; Jane scolded, &#8220;you need a guardian.
Don&#8217;t you know that you shouldn&#8217;t sit out in such
weather as this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>She presented him to Frederick. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you
come in, Mr. Towne?&#8221;</p>

<p>But he would not. He would call her up. Jane
stood on the porch and watched him go down
the steps. He waved to her when he reached his
car.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Evans,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve had such a day.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went into the house together. Jane lighted
the lamp. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you dine with us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hoped you might ask me. Mother is staying
with a sick friend. If I go home, I shall sup on
bread and milk.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>&#8220;Sophy&#8217;s chops will be much better.&#8221; She held
her flowers up to him. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t the fragrance
heavenly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Towne gave them to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded. &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve been very grand and gorgeous&mdash;lunch
at the Chevy Chase club&mdash;a long
drive afterward&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she broke off. &#8220;Evans, you
look half-frozen. Sit here by the fire and get
warm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I met both trains.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Evans</i>&mdash;why will you do such things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can see me any time&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot. Not when you are lunching with
fashionable gentlemen with gold-lined pocket-books.&#8221;
He held out his hands to the blaze. &#8220;Do
you like him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Towne? Yes, and I like the things he does
for me. I had to pinch myself to be sure it was
true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If what was true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I was really playing around with the
great Frederick Towne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You talk as if he were conferring a favor.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had her coat off now and her hat. She came
and sat down in the chair opposite him. &#8220;Evans,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;you&#8217;re jealous.&#8221; She was still vivid with
the excitement of the afternoon, lighted up by it,
her skin warmed into color by the swift flowing
blood beneath.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>&#8220;Well, I am jealous,&#8221; he tried to smile at her,
then went on with a touch of bitterness, &#8220;Do you
know what I thought about as I sat watching the
lights at Mrs. Allison&#8217;s? Well, as I came over to-day
I passed a snowy field&mdash;and there was a scarecrow
in the midst of it, fluttering his rags, a lonely
thing, an ugly thing. Well, we&#8217;re two of a kind,
Jane, that scarecrow and I.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her shocked glance stopped him. &#8220;Evans, you
don&#8217;t know what you are saying.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went on recklessly. &#8220;Well, after all, Jane,
the thing is this. It&#8217;s a man&#8217;s looks and his money
that count. I&#8217;m the same man inside of me that I
was when I went away. You know that. You
might have loved me. The thing that is left you
don&#8217;t love. Yet I am the same man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>As he flung the words at her, her eyes met his
steadily. &#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you are not the same
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man of yesterday did not think&mdash;dark
thoughts&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The light had gone out of her as if he had blown
it with a breath. &#8220;Jane,&#8221; he said, unsteadily, &#8220;I
am sorry&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She melted at once and began to scold him, almost
with tenderness. &#8220;What made you <i>look</i> at
the scarecrow? Why didn&#8217;t you turn your back on
him, or if you <i>had</i> to look, why didn&#8217;t you wave and
say, &#8216;Cheer up, old chap, summer&#8217;s coming, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
you&#8217;ll be on the job again&#8217;? To me there&#8217;s something
debonair in a scarecrow in summer&mdash;he
dances in the breeze and seems to fling defiance to
the crows.&#8221;</p>

<p>He fell in with her mood. &#8220;But his defiance is
all bluff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know? If he keeps away a crow,
and adds an ear of corn to a farmer&#8217;s store&mdash;hasn&#8217;t
he fulfilled his destiny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if you want to put it that way. I suppose
you are hinting that I can keep away a crow or
two&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not hinting, I am telling it straight
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>They heard Baldy&#8217;s step in the hall. Jane, rising,
gave Evans&#8217; head a pat as she passed him.
&#8220;You are thinking about yourself too much, old
dear; stop it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baldy, ramping in, demanded a detailed account
of Jane&#8217;s adventure.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I took Briggs to market,&#8221; she told him
gleefully, midway of her recital; &#8220;you should have
seen him. He carried my parcels&mdash;and offered advice&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Baldy had no ears for Briggs&#8217; attractions. &#8220;Did
you get the things Miss Towne wanted?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We did. We went to the house and I waited in
the car while Mr. Towne had the bags packed. He
wanted me to go in but I wouldn&#8217;t. We brought
her bags out with us.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>&#8220;Who&#8217;s we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Towne and I, myself,&#8221; she added the spectacular
details.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that you&#8217;ve been playing around
with him all day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not all day, Baldy. Part of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that I like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man like that. He might fill your head with
ideas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope my head is filled with ideas, Baldy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that I might think he would fall in
love with me. Well, I don&#8217;t. But he likes to play
and so do I. I hope he&#8217;ll do it some more. And
you and Evans are a pair of croakers. Here, I&#8217;ve
been having the time of my life, and you&#8217;re both
trying to take the joy out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They began to protest. She flung off their apologies.
&#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s eat dinner. Between the two of
you you&#8217;ve spoiled my day.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she was too light-hearted to hold resentment,
and by the time the coffee came she was
herself again. After dinner, Baldy telephoned
Edith, and came back to set the victrola going to
a most riotous tune and danced with Jane. It was
an outlet for his emotions. <i>Edith ... Edith
... Edith</i> ... was the tune to which he
danced.</p>

<p>Then he made Jane play his accompaniment and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
sang the passionate lines of a poet much derided
by the moderns:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;She is coming, my own, my sweet,</div>
<div class="verse">Were it ever so airy a tread,</div>
<div class="verse">My heart would hear her and beat,</div>
<div class="verse">Had it lain for a century dead,</div>
<div class="verse">Would start and tremble under her feet,</div>
<div class="verse">And blossom in purple and red.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The waves of lovely sound rose higher and higher,
seemed to break over and engulf them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;My heart would hear her and beat....</div>
<div class="verse">Would start and tremble under her feet,</div>
<div class="verse">And blossom in purple and red.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Evans, walking home an hour later, took the
path which led beneath the pines. The old trees
showed thin and black against the moon-bright sky.
Beyond the pines was the field with the scarecrow.
Evans might have avoided it by following the road,
but he was drawn to it by a sort of sinister attraction,
and by the memory of the things he had said
to Jane.</p>

<p>Under the moon the scarecrow took on more than
ever the semblance of a man. Lightly clad in straw
hat and pajamas, it seemed to shiver and shake in
the bleak and bitter night.</p>

<p>Evans leaned on a fence post and surveyed his
fantastic prototype. The air was very still&mdash;no
sound but the faint whistle of the wind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>Then out of the stillness&mdash;clear as a bell&mdash;Jane&#8217;s
husky voice. &#8220;<i>The man of yesterday did not think
dark thoughts.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>He seemed to answer her. &#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t I
think them? My dreams are dead. And oh, my
dear, what have you to do with dead dreams?&#8221;</p>

<p>He had thought he would be satisfied just to have
her near him. But he knew now that he would not
be satisfied. He had known it from the moment he
had seen her with Towne. Always hereafter there
would be the fear that she might be taken from
him. And it was Frederick Towne who might take
her. He had everything to offer. Any girl&#8217;s head
might be turned.</p>

<p>Towne&#8217;s infatuation was evident. And Jane was
exquisite&mdash;in mind and soul as well as body. It
wasn&#8217;t a thing for a man to miss.</p>

<p>He was chilled to the bone when at last he took
leave of the ghostly figure in the straw hat. The
old scarecrow seemed to lean towards him wistfully
as he went away.... Oh, the thing was
so human&mdash;he wanted to offer it shelter, a warm
hearth.... He flung back at it as the best he
could do, Jane&#8217;s words, &#8220;Cheer up, old chap, summer&#8217;s
coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he reached home, Evans went at once to
the library. Rusty was in his basket by the fire.
He lifted himself stiffly and whined. Evans knelt
beside the basket, and held up a saucer of milk
that the old dog might drink. Then he took a book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
from the shelf and sat down to read. His mother
had not returned. She had telephoned to him at
Jane&#8217;s that she might be late.</p>

<p>But he could not read. He sat with his book in
his hand, and looked up at the portrait of his grandfather,
and at the photograph of himself. After a
while he rose and took the photograph from the
shelf, observing it at close range.</p>

<p>What a gallant young chap he had been, and
what a pair he and Jane would have made! There
was no vanity in that&mdash;he would have matched his
youth with hers in those days. Oh, the man in the
picture was a fit mate for Jane!</p>

<p>The man who held the picture in his hand was a
mate for&mdash;nobody!</p>

<p>With a sudden furious gesture, he flung it from
him&mdash;the glass broke against the wall when it
struck.</p>

<p>Rusty whined in his basket, his nose over the
edge of it. His master stood as still as a statue in
the center of the hearth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Mrs. Follette returned, her son met her at
the door. If he was pale, she did not speak of it.
&#8220;I am half-frozen, Evans; we came in an open car.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down by the fire, and I&#8217;ll get you some hot
milk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would. I must not risk a cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a fact that she could not. She was up
early every morning, directing the men who worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
for her, and superintending the careful handling of
the milk. Evans had offered, repeatedly, to help
her, but she liked to do it herself. She was very
competent, and she had built up her own business
while her son was in the war. It seemed best to
carry it on without him. She did not like to think
of Evans as a milkman. A woman did not so easily
lose caste&mdash;distinguished Englishwomen had gone
into all kinds of occupations. The thing was to do
it with an air. She had decided shrewdly that she
must in some way differentiate her product from
that of the ordinary dairyman, so she had called
it <span class="smcap">Gold Seal</span> milk, and each bottle was closed with
a small gold seal bearing her family crest. Evans
had laughed at her, but her shrewdness had been
justified. She kept her cows in fine condition and
sent her cards to doctors. The cards, too, bore the
gold seal. And soon her reputation was established.
Big cars stopped at her door, and people
who came expecting to find a crude countrywoman
were ushered into the old library with its portraits
and an imposing background of books. There Mrs.
Follette, in quiet black with white cuffs and collars,
her gray hair high, received them. Her customers
went away impressed and told others.</p>

<p>Outwardly calm on such occasions, Mrs. Follette
was inwardly excited. She had a feeling that the
situation smacked of Marie Antoinette at Little
Trianon. She was glad she had thought of selling
milk&mdash;it seemed to link her subtly with royalty.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>She had a royal air now as she sat before the
fire. She always dressed for dinner. Her shabby
black gown showed a round of white neck. She
wore a string of jet beads and her satin slippers
were adorned with jet buckles. She had pretty
feet&mdash;and she surveyed them complacently. Then
her eyes traveled beyond them to something that
lay in a far corner.</p>

<p>She went over to it and picked it up. It was the
photograph of Evans which had always stood on
the mantel. The broken glass fell from it with a
tinkling sound. She had it in her hand when Evans
came in.</p>

<p>&#8220;How in the world did it happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>He set the small tray carefully on the table. &#8220;I
threw it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;my dear boy, why?&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood looking at her. She saw his paleness.
&#8220;Oh, well, for a moment I was a&mdash;fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was not an imaginative woman. But she
knew what he meant. And her chin quivered. She
was no longer royal. She was the mother of a hurt
child. &#8220;I hoped things might&mdash;grow easier&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They grow harder&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down on the rug at her feet as he had sat
through the years of little boyhood. Her left hand
with its old-fashioned diamond rings hung by her
side. He took it in his. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Mumsie,
I told you I was a&mdash;fool. And it was all over in a
second&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>She knew it was not over, but she drank her milk.
Then she drew his head against her knees, and told
him about her visit and her sick friend. Nothing
more was said of the picture, but all through her
recital he clung to her hand.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />

<small>BALDY AS AMBASSADOR</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Baldy Barnes</span> faring forth to find Edith Towne
on Sunday morning was a figure as old as the ages&mdash;youth
in quest of romance.</p>

<p>It was very cold and the clouds were heavy with
wind. But neither cold nor clouds could damp his
ardor&mdash;at his journey&#8217;s end was a lady with eyes
of burning blue.</p>

<p>People were going to church as he came into the
city and bells were ringing, but presently he rode
again in country silences. He crossed the long
bridge into Virginia and followed the road to the
south.</p>

<p>It was early and he met few cars. Yet had the
way been packed with motors, he would have still
been alone in that world of imagination where he
saw Edith Towne and that first wonderful moment
of meeting.</p>

<p>So he entered Alexandria, passing through the
narrow streets that speak so eloquently of history.
Beyond the town was another stretch of road
parallel to the broad stream, and at last an ancient
roadside inn, of red brick, with a garden at the
back, barren now, but in summer a tangle of bloom,
with an expanse of reeds and water plants, extending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
out into the river, and a low spidery boat-landing,
which showed black at this season above the
ice.</p>

<p>For years the old inn had been deserted, until
motor cars had brought back its vanished glories.
Once more its wide doors were open. There was
nothing pretentious about it. But Baldy knew its
reputation for genuine hospitality.</p>

<p>He wondered how Edith had kept herself hidden
in such a place. It was amazing that no one had
discovered her. That some hint of her presence
had not been given to the newspapers.</p>

<p>He found her in a quaint sitting-room up-stairs.
&#8220;I think,&#8221; she said to him, as he came in, &#8220;that
you are very good-natured to take all this trouble
for me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t any trouble.&#8221; His assurance was gone.
With her hat off she was doubly wonderful. He
felt his youth and inexperience, yet words
came to him, &#8220;And I didn&#8217;t do it for you, I did it
for myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed. &#8220;Do you always say such nice
things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall always say them to you. And you
mustn&#8217;t mind. Really,&#8221; Jane would have recognized
returning confidence in that cock of the head,
&#8220;I&#8217;m just a page&mdash;twanging a lyre.&#8221;</p>

<p>They laughed together. He was great fun, she
decided, different.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are wondering, I fancy, how I happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
to come here,&#8221; she said, leaning back in her chair,
her burnished hair against its faded cushions.
&#8220;Well, an old cook of Mother&#8217;s, Martha Burns, is
the wife of the landlord. She will do anything for
me. I have had all my meals up-stairs. I might
be a thousand miles away for all my world knows
of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was worried to death when I thought of you
out in the storm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And all the while I was sitting with my feet
on the fender, reading about myself in the evening
papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what you read was a-plenty,&#8221; said Baldy,
slangily. &#8220;Some of those reporters deserve to be
shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they had to do it,&#8221; indifferently, &#8220;and what
they have said is nothing to what my friends are
saying. It&#8217;s a choice morsel. Every girl who ever
wanted Del&#8217;s millions is crowing over the way he
treated me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The look in his eyes disconcerted her. &#8220;Do you
really think that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. We&#8217;re a greedy bunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to hear you say such things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because&mdash;you aren&#8217;t greedy. You know it. It
wasn&#8217;t his millions you were after.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was I after? I wish you&#8217;d tell me. I
don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I think you just followed the flock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Other girls got married. So you would marry.
You didn&#8217;t know anything about love&mdash;or you
wouldn&#8217;t have done it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know I&#8217;ve never been in love?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it is. I don&#8217;t know, really.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll know some day. And you mustn&#8217;t ever
think of yourself as mercenary. You&#8217;re too wonderful
for that&mdash;too&mdash;too fine&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She realized in that moment that the boy was in
earnest. That he was not saying pretty things to
her for the sake of saying them. He was saying
them all in sincerity. &#8220;It is nice of you to believe
in me. But you don&#8217;t know me. I am like the little
girl with the curl. I can be very, very good, but
sometimes I am &#8216;horrid.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t make me think it.&#8221; He handed her a
packet of letters. &#8220;Your uncle sent these. There&#8217;s
one from Simms on top.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I won&#8217;t read it. I won&#8217;t read any of
them. It has been heavenly to be away from things.
I feel like a disembodied spirit, looking on but having
nothing to do with the world I have left.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were smiling now. &#8220;I can believe that,&#8221;
Baldy said, &#8220;but I think you ought to read Simms&#8217;
letter. You needn&#8217;t tell me you haven&#8217;t any curiosity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I have,&#8221; she broke the envelope. &#8220;More
than that I am madly curious. I wouldn&#8217;t confess
it though to anyone&mdash;but you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>&#8220;They can cut me up in little pieces&mdash;before I
break my silence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again they laughed together. Then she broke
the seal of the letter. Read it through to herself,
then read it a second time aloud.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Now that it is all over, Edith, I want to tell
you how it happened. I know you think it is a
rotten thing I did. But it would have been worse
if I had married you. I am in love with another
woman, and I did not find it out until the day of
our wedding.</p>

<p>&#8220;She isn&#8217;t in the least to blame, and somehow
I can&#8217;t feel that I am quite the cad that everybody
is calling me. Things are bigger sometimes than
ourselves. Fate just took me that morning&mdash;and
swept me away from you.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t her fault. She wouldn&#8217;t go away with
me, although I begged her to do it. And she was
right of course.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is poor, but she isn&#8217;t marrying me for my
money. The world will say she is&mdash;but the world
doesn&#8217;t recognize the <i>real thing</i>. It has come to
me, and if it ever comes to you, you&#8217;re going to
thank me for this&mdash;but now you&#8217;ll hate me, and
I&#8217;m sorry. You&#8217;re a beautiful, wonderful woman&mdash;and
I find no excuse for myself, except the one
that it would have been a crime under the circumstances
to tie us to each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;In spite of everything,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gap">&#8220;Faithfully,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Del</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence, as she finished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Then Edith said, &#8220;So that&#8217;s that,&#8221; and tore the
letter into little shreds. Her blue eyes were like
bits of steel.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Baldy. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to kill him
for making you unhappy&mdash;but the thing was bigger
than himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. &#8220;Of course if you
are going to condone&mdash;dishonor&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He was leaning forward hugging his knees. &#8220;I
am not condoning anything. But&mdash;I know this&mdash;that
some day if you ever fall in love, you&#8217;ll forgive&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not likely to fall in love,&#8221; coldly, &#8220;I&#8217;m too
sensible&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He studied her with his bright gray eyes. &#8220;Oh,
no, you&#8217;re not. You&#8217;re not in the least&mdash;sensible.
You think you are because the men you&#8217;ve met have
been poor sticks who couldn&#8217;t make you care&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve met some of the most distinguished men in
America&mdash;and a few of them have fallen in love
with me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know. You&#8217;ve had strings of lovers&mdash;you&#8217;re
too tremendously lovely not to have. But
they&#8217;ve all been afraid of you. No caveman stuff&mdash;or
anything like that. Isn&#8217;t that the truth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should hate a caveman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, but you wouldn&#8217;t be indifferent, and
you&#8217;d end by caring&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dislike brutal types&mdash;intensely&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat with his chin in his hand, his shoulders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
hunched up like a faun or Pan at his pipes. &#8220;All
cavemen aren&#8217;t brutal types. Some day I&#8217;m going
to paint a picture of a man carrying off a woman.
And I&#8217;m going to make him a slender young god&mdash;and
she shall be a rather substantial goddess&mdash;but
she&#8217;ll go with him&mdash;his spirit shall conquer
her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him in surprise. &#8220;Then you
paint?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say I do. Terrible things&mdash;magazine covers.
But in the back of my mind there are masterpieces&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He was a whimsical youngster, she decided. But
no end interesting. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe your things
are terrible. And I shall want to see them&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going to see them. I have a studio in
our garage. I sometimes wonder what happens at
night when my little Ford is left alone with my fantasies.
It must feel that it is fighting devils&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He broke off to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m as garrulous as Jane.
Please don&#8217;t let me talk any more about myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Jane your sister?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. And now let&#8217;s get down to realities.
Your uncle wants you to come home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going. I know Uncle Fred. He&#8217;ll
make me feel like a returned prodigal. He&#8217;ll kill
the fatted calf, but I&#8217;ll always know that there
were husks&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And hogs,&#8221; Baldy supplemented, dreamily.
&#8220;Some people are like that.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>&#8220;He&#8217;s always been worshipped by women. And
I didn&#8217;t fall at his feet. That&#8217;s why we didn&#8217;t get
on. He ruled his mother and his servants&mdash;and he
couldn&#8217;t rule me. And he&#8217;d run away to his affinities
to be comforted, and they&#8217;d tell him what a cat
I was&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Affinities?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I call them that, because there has always
been a procession of them. Women he adores for
the moment. But it never lasts, and they spoil
him to death&mdash;and I won&#8217;t spoil him. I like my
own way, too, sometimes, and I fight for it. And
I am the only person in the world who makes Uncle
Frederick lose his temper. And he hates that.
His manners are lovely as a rule, but he simply
blows up when we get into an argument.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was not a goddess&mdash;she was intensely human&mdash;a
soul fighting to be free, and he wanted to help
her fight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he said suddenly, &#8220;if I were you
I&#8217;d go back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you ought. Face things out. Let your
uncle understand that there are to be no postmortems.
It is the only thing to do. You can&#8217;t stay
here forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did Uncle Fred make you his ambassador?&#8221;
coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He did not. When I came, I felt that I would
do anything to keep you away from home as long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
you liked. But I don&#8217;t feel that way now. You&#8217;ll
just sit here and grow bitter about it&mdash;instead of
thanking God on your knees.&#8221;</p>

<p>He flung it at her, unexpectedly. There was a
moment&#8217;s intense silence. Then he said, &#8220;Oh, I
hope you don&#8217;t think I am preaching&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;no&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and suddenly her head went
down on her arm, that beautiful burnished head.</p>

<p>She was crying!</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he told her, huskily.</p>

<p>And again there was silence.</p>

<p>She hunted for her handkerchief, and he handed
her his. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t be sorry,&#8221; she said; &#8220;it
seems&mdash;rather refreshing to have someone say
things like that. Oh, I wonder if you know how
hard we are&mdash;and cynical&mdash;the people of my set.
And I don&#8217;t believe any of us ever&mdash;thank God.&#8221;</p>

<p>She wiped her eyes, found her own handkerchief,
and handed his back to him. She did not know
how he treasured it&mdash;afterward&mdash;a chalice for her
tears. She found it many years later&mdash;shut away
in a box with a sprig of heliotrope.</p>

<p>They talked for an hour after that. &#8220;There is
no reason why you should hurry back,&#8221; Baldy said,
&#8220;but I&#8217;d let your uncle tell people where you are.
Then the papers will drop it, don&#8217;t you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see. Of course I&#8217;ve been silly&mdash;but you can&#8217;t
think how I suffered.&#8221;</p>

<p>She would not have admitted it to anyone else.
But she met his sincerity with her own.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>&#8220;I was going to have our lunch served up here,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;but I think I won&#8217;t. The dining-room
down-stairs is charming&mdash;and if anyone comes in
that I know&mdash;I shan&#8217;t care&mdash;as long as I&#8217;m going
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mammoth fireplace in the old dining-room
had been restored to ancient uses. Martha and her
husband had recognized its value as a background,
so meat was roasted on the spit&mdash;a turkey to-day as
it happened. The tables were lighted by high white
candles&mdash;and there were old hunting prints on the
walls.</p>

<p>The food was delicious, and having settled her
problems, Edith showed herself delightfully gay
and girlish. There was heliotrope in a Sheffield
bowl on their table. &#8220;Martha grows old-fashioned
flowers in pots,&#8221; Edith said. She picked out a
spray for him and he put it in his coat. &#8220;It&#8217;s my
favorite.&#8221; She told him about Delafield&#8217;s orchids.
&#8220;Think of all those months,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and he
never knew the flowers I like.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were other people in the room, but it was
not until the end of the meal that anyone came
whom Edith recognized.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eloise Harper&mdash;and she sees me,&#8221; was her
sudden remark. &#8220;Now watch me carry it
off.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood up and waved to a party of four people,
two men and two women, who stood in the
door.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>They saw her at once, and the effect of their coming
was a stampede.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blessed child,&#8221; said the girl who was in the
lead, &#8220;have you eloped? And is this the man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Mr. Barnes,&#8221; said Edith, &#8220;who comes
from my uncle. I am to go back. But I have had
a corking adventure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Only Baldy knew what was in her heart, and how
hard it was to face them. But on the surface she
was as sparkling as the rest of them. &#8220;I shall
probably be in the papers again to-morrow morning.
You know you won&#8217;t be able to keep it, Eloise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eloise, red-haired and vivid in a cloak and turban
of wood-brown, seemed to stand mentally on tiptoe.
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t miss the talk I am going to have with
the reporters to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the men of the party protested. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
be an idiot, Eloise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I owe Edith something. Don&#8217;t I, darling?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do.&#8221; There was a flame in back of Edith&#8217;s
eyes. &#8220;She liked Delafield before I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cat,&#8221; said Eloise lightly. &#8220;I liked his yacht,
but Benny&#8217;s is bigger, isn&#8217;t it, Benny?&#8221; She
turned to the younger man of the party who had
not spoken.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say it is,&#8221; Benny agreed, cheerfully, &#8220;and
it isn&#8217;t just my yacht that she&#8217;s after. She has
a real little case on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The second woman, older than Eloise, tall and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
fair-haired in smoke-gray with a sweep of dull blue
wing across her hat, said, &#8220;Edith, you bad child,
your uncle has been frightfully worried.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, you&#8217;d know, Adelaide. And it does
him good to be worried. I am an antidote for the
rest of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everybody laughed except Baldy. He ran his
fingers with a nervous gesture through his hair.
He was like a young eagle with a ruffled crest.</p>

<p>Martha came up to arrange for a table. &#8220;Bring
your coffee over and sit with us,&#8221; Eloise said; &#8220;we
want to hear all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edith shook her head. &#8220;I don&#8217;t belong to your
world yet. And I&#8217;ve had a heavenly time without
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went on laughing. Silence settled on the
two they left behind. And out of that silence Edith
asked, &#8220;You didn&#8217;t like the things we said?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hateful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you always show what you feel like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane says I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if it had been anybody but Eloise Harper
and Adelaide Laramore. Adelaide is Uncle Fred&#8217;s
latest.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go up-stairs. If I stay here I
shall want to throw things at their heads. And I
don&#8217;t care to break Martha&#8217;s dishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>They stopped at the other table, however, for a
light word or two, then went up to Edith&#8217;s sitting-room
on the second floor. When they were once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
more by the fire, she said, &#8220;And now what do you
think of me? Nice temper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; he said, promptly, &#8220;that they probably
deserved it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laid her hand for a fleeting moment on his
arm. &#8220;You are rather a darling to say that. I was
really horrid.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he was ready at last to go, she decided,
&#8220;Tell Uncle Frederick to send Briggs out for me
in the morning. I might as well have it over, now
that Eloise is going to spread the news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d go in with me&mdash;to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but I couldn&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>She weighed it&mdash;&#8220;And surprise Uncle Fred?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;d better telephone, so he can kill the
fatted calf.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He doesn&#8217;t like things sprung on him.
Hurts his dignity&mdash;but he&#8217;s rather an old dear, and
I love him&mdash;do you ever quarrel with the people you
love?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane and I fight. Great times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a feeling I shall like Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will. She&#8217;s the best ever. Not a beauty,
but growing better-looking every day. Bobbed her
hair&mdash;and I nearly took her head off. But she&#8217;s
rather a peach.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have you both down for dinner some day.
I think we are going to be friends&#8221;&mdash;again that
light touch on his arm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>He caught her hand in his. &#8220;I shall only ask
that you let the page twang his lyre.&#8221; Then with
a deeper note, &#8220;Miss Towne, I can&#8217;t tell you how
much your friendship would mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would it? Oh, I am going to have some good
times with you and your little sister, Jane. I am
so tired of people like Eloise and Adelaide, and
Benny and&mdash;Del....&#8221;</p>

<p>On this same afternoon little Lucy Logan was
writing to Delafield Simms.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;It seems like a dream, lover, that you are to
come for me in February, and that then we&#8217;ll be
married. And that all the rest of my life I am to
belong to you.</p>

<p>&#8220;Del, it isn&#8217;t because you are rich. Of course
I shall adore the things you can do for me. I am
not going to pretend that I shan&#8217;t. But if you
were poor, I&#8217;d work for you&mdash;live for you. Oh,
Del, I do hope that you will believe it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The other day, Mr. Towne said in one of his
letters that you had always been fickle, that there
had been lots of girls, Eloise Harper before Edith.
And I wanted to scream right out and say, &#8216;It isn&#8217;t
true. He hasn&#8217;t ever really cared before this.&#8217;
But of course I couldn&#8217;t. But I broke a pencil
point, and as for Mr. Towne, who is he to say such
things about you? I haven&#8217;t taken his letters for
the last three years for nothing. There&#8217;s always
somebody&mdash;the last one was Mrs. Laramore, and
now he has his eye on a little Jane Barnes, whose
brother found Miss Towne&#8217;s bag and the ring.
She&#8217;s rather a darling, but I hope she won&#8217;t think
he is in earnest.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>&#8220;And now, my dear and my darling, good-night.
I wonder how I dare call you that. But I am
always saying it to myself, and at night I ask God
to keep you&mdash;safe.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Five days later, Delafield read Lucy&#8217;s letter. He
was on his yacht in southern waters. His man had
been sent in for the mail.</p>

<p>When he had finished, Delafield lay back in his
deck chair and thought about it. Queer thing for
him to fall like that for little Lucy. He had not
believed that it was in him to care in that way for
a woman. But he did. The letter lay like a live
warm thing under his hand. It seemed to beat
with his heart as Lucy&#8217;s heart had beat against his
own on that last morning in Frederick Towne&#8217;s
office, while his bride waited.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>THE DIM LANTERN</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>, in Baldy&#8217;s absence, dined on Sunday with
the Follettes, in the middle of the day. In the afternoon
she and Evans went for a walk, and came
home to tea in the library.</p>

<p>Stretched in a long leather chair, Evans read to
Jane and his mother &#8220;The Eve of St. Agnes.&#8221;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;How bitter cold it was!</div>
<div class="verse">The owl, for all his feathers, was a-cold:</div>
<div class="verse">The hare limp&#8217;d trembling through the frozen grass,</div>
<div class="verse">And silent were the flock in woolly fold.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Jane, curled up on the couch in her favorite attitude,
listened to that incomparable description of
stark winter weather, and was glad of the warmth
and coziness. She was glad, too, of this pleasant
company&mdash;Mrs. Follette was a great dear, with her
duchess air, and her devotion to Evans. And
Evans, reading in that thrilling and unchanged
voice, was at his best.</p>

<p>As for Mrs. Follette, she was always glad to have
Jane visit them. The child was so cheerful, and
Evans needed cheer. Then, too, Jane was a delightful
compromise between the girl of yesterday
and the ultra-modern maiden who shocked Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Follette not only by her lack of reverence but by
her lack of reticence.</p>

<p>Jane might have bobbed hair, but she did not
have a bobbed-hair mind. The meaning of this
conclusion was quite clear to Mrs. Follette, however
obscure it might be to others. Girls who cut
off their hair, as a rule, went farther&mdash;Jane stopped
at her hair.</p>

<p>Then, too, Jane had what might be called old-fashioned
domestic qualities. She kept her little
house as spick and span as she kept herself. In
winter everything was burnished and bright; in
summer crisp curtains waved in the warm breeze;
there were cool shadows within the clean, quiet
rooms.</p>

<p>At the moment, Mrs. Follette was weighing seriously
the fact of Jane as a wife for Evans. She
was pretty as well as cheerful. Had good manners.
Of course, in the old days, Evans would, inevitably,
have looked higher. There had been plenty of rich
girls eager to attract him. He had had unlimited
invitations. Women had, in fact, quite run after
him. Florence Preston had rather made a fool of
herself. And Florence&#8217;s father had millions.</p>

<p>But now&mdash;&mdash;? Mrs. Follette knew how little
Evans had at the moment to offer. She hated to
admit it, but the truth was evident. Watching the
two young people, she decided that should Evans
care for Jane, she would erect no barriers. As for
Jane, marriage with Evans would be, in a way, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
rise in the world. She would live at Castle Manor
instead of at Sherwood Park.</p>

<p>The poem had reached a point where Mrs. Follette
felt that she ought to protest. She was not
quite sure that she approved of the situation it outlined.
The verse of the moment, for example&mdash;Porphyro&#8217;s
plea to the maid, old Angela:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;To lead him in close secrecy,</div>
<div class="verse">Even to Madelaine&#8217;s chamber and there hide</div>
<div class="verse">Him in a closet of such privacy,</div>
<div class="verse">That he might see her beauty unspy&#8217;d</div>
<div class="verse">And win, perhaps, that night, a peerless bride.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Stripped of all its fine words, it was an impossible
situation.</p>

<p>Apparently, however, the young people were
without self-consciousness....</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Out went the taper, as she hurried in:</div>
<div class="verse">Its little smoke in pallid moonshine died&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Evans looked up. &#8220;Could there be anything
lovelier than that last line?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane&#8217;s eyes had dreams in them. &#8220;Don&#8217;t stop,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>He read on.... &#8220;She closed the door ...&#8221;
his voice took now a deeper note.</p>



<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Rose-bloom fell on her hands, together prest,</div>
<div class="verse">And on her silver cross soft amethyst,</div>
<div class="verse">And on her hair a glory like a saint:</div>
<div class="verse">She seemed a splendid angel, newly drest,</div>
<div class="verse">Save wings for heaven; Porphyro grew faint:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></div>
<div class="verse">She knelt so pure a thing, so free from mortal taint.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Evans,&#8221; said his mother, as he paused again,
&#8220;that poem doesn&#8217;t seem to me exactly proper.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave her a surprised glance. &#8220;Don&#8217;t spoil it
for us, Mumsie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; Mrs. Follette shrugged her nice
shoulders, &#8220;we won&#8217;t argue. But when I was a
girl we didn&#8217;t read things like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this was written before you were a girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What difference does that make?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the richness and color. You see it, Jane,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Finish it, Evans.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when he came to the end, she said, &#8220;If only
life were like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;High romance. Porphyro says negligently,
&#8216;For o&#8217;er the southern moors I have a home for
thee.&#8217; But lovers of to-day have to think of rent
and food and clothes. And hotel bills for the
honeymoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you women&#8221;&mdash;he sat up flaming&mdash;&#8220;are
you conspiring to spoil my poem? Jane, it is the
dreams of men and women which shape their lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>As his eyes met hers something stirred within
her like the flutter of a bird&#8217;s wings lifted to the
sun....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>It was after five when Baldy telephoned triumphantly:
&#8220;Jane, Edith Towne has agreed to
go home to-night. And I&#8217;m to take her. I called
up Mr. Towne and told him and he wants you to
be there when we come. He&#8217;ll send Briggs for you
and we are all to have dinner together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Baldy, I don&#8217;t know Edith Towne. Why
doesn&#8217;t he ask some of her own friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t want &#8217;em. Hates them all, and
anyhow he has asked you. Why worry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to go home and dress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re to let him know at once where
Briggs can get you. I told him you were at the
Follettes&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane went back and repeated the conversation to
Evans and his mother. Mrs. Follette was much
interested. The Townes were most important people.
&#8220;How nice for you, Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Evans disagreed with her. &#8220;What makes
you say that, Mother? It isn&#8217;t nice. It will simply
be upsetting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you say that, Evans,&#8221; Jane
argued. &#8220;I am not easily upset.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But with all that money. You can&#8217;t keep up
with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t put ideas into Jane&#8217;s head,&#8221; his mother
remonstrated; &#8220;a lady is always a lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Jane sided now with Evans. &#8220;I see what
he means, Mrs. Follette. I haven&#8217;t the clothes. I
haven&#8217;t a thing to wear to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, I wasn&#8217;t thinking of your looks.&#8221; Evans
got up and stood on the hearth-rug. &#8220;But people
like that! Jane, I wish you wouldn&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up at him with her chin tilted. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t see how I can refuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course she can&#8217;t. Evans, don&#8217;t be so unreasonable,&#8221;
Mrs. Follette interposed; &#8220;it will be
a wonderful thing for Jane to know Edith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will it be such a wonderful thing for her to
know Frederick Towne?&#8221; He flung it at them.</p>

<p>Jane demanded, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you want me to have any
good times?&#8221;</p>

<p>He stared at her for a moment, and when he
spoke it was in a different tone. &#8220;Yes, of course.
I beg your pardon, Janey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Follette, having effaced herself for the moment
from the conversation, decided that things
between her son and little Jane Barnes might reach
a climax at any moment. &#8220;I believe he&#8217;s half in
love with her,&#8221; she told herself in some bewilderment.</p>

<p>As for Frederick Towne, she didn&#8217;t consider him
for a moment. Jane was a pretty child. But Frederick
Towne could have his pick of women. There
would be nothing serious in this friendship with
Jane.</p>

<p>Jane called up Towne. &#8220;It was good of you to
ask me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am at the Follettes&#8217;, but I&#8217;ll
go home and dress and Briggs can come for me
there.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>&#8220;Come as you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t say that if you could see me. I
took a walk with Evans this afternoon and I show
the effects of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Evans? Oh, Casabianca?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you call him that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought of it when I saw him waiting for
you at the top of the terrace. &#8216;The boy stood on
the burning deck&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;&#8221; he laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s funny at all,&#8221; said Jane,
frankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you? Well, I beg your pardon. I&#8217;ll beg
it again when I get you here. Briggs will reach
Sherwood at about seven. I would drive out myself,
but I&#8217;ve an awful cold, and the doctor tells
me I must stay in. And Cousin Annabel is sick in
bed with a cold, so you must take pity on me and
keep me company....&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane hung up the receiver. It would, she decided,
be an exciting adventure. But she was not
sure that she liked Frederick Towne....</p>

<p>Evans walked home with her. The air was
warmer than it had been for days, and faint mists
had risen. The mist thickened finally to a fog
which rolled over them as if blown from the high
seas. Yet the sea was miles away, and the fog was
born in the rivers and streams, and in the melting
snows.</p>

<p>They found it somewhat difficult to keep to the
road. They were almost smothered in the thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
gray masses. Their voices had a muffled sound.
Evans&#8217; hand was on Jane&#8217;s arm so that they might
keep together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I made a fool of myself about
Towne. But honestly&mdash;I was afraid&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That he might fall in love with you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not thinking of me, Evans, and besides
he&#8217;s too old&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really feel that way about it, Jane?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course&mdash;silly.&#8221;</p>

<p>He could not see her face&mdash;but the words in her
laughing lovely voice gave him a sense of reassurance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Janey,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if I could only have you like
this always. Shut away from the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to be shut away. I should
feel&mdash;caged&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if you cared.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was in his tone the huskiness of intense
feeling. She was moved by it. &#8220;Oh, I know what
you mean. But love won&#8217;t come to me like that&mdash;shut
in. I shall want freedom, and sunshine. I&#8217;ll
be a gull over the sea&mdash;a ship in full sail&mdash;a gypsy
on the road&mdash;but I&#8217;ll never be a ghost in a fog.&#8221;</p>

<p>His hand dropped from her arm. &#8220;Perhaps
you&#8217;ll be a princess in a castle. Towne can make
you that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you keep harping on Mr. Towne? I
don&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>&#8220;Because&mdash;oh, I think everybody wants
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And now it was she who caught at his arm in
the mist, and leaned on it. &#8220;I&#8217;m not the least in
love with Frederick Towne. And I shall never
marry a man I don&#8217;t love, Evans.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they came to the little house they found
old Sophy nodding in the kitchen. She always
stayed with Jane when Baldy was away. So
Evans said &#8220;Good-night&#8221; and started back.</p>

<p>He found the path between the pines, walked a
few steps and stumbled. He sat down on the log
that had tripped him. He had no wish to go on.
His depression was intense. Night was before him
and darkness. Loneliness. And Jane would be
with Frederick Towne.</p>

<p>He had for Jane a feeling of hopeless adoration.
She would never be his. For how could he try to
keep her? &#8220;I&#8217;ll be a gull over the sea&mdash;a ship in
full sail&mdash;a gypsy on the road&mdash;never a ghost in a
fog.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he was just a ghost in a fog! Oh, what was
the use of ever &#8220;climbing up the climbing wave&#8221;?
One must have something of hope to live on. A
dream or two&mdash;ahead.</p>

<p>How long he sat there he did not know. And
all at once he was aware of a pale blur against the
prevailing gloom. And then he heard Jane&#8217;s voice
calling, &#8220;Evans? Evans?&#8221;</p>

<p>He answered and she came up to him. &#8220;Your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
mother telephoned&mdash;that you had not come home&mdash;and
she was worried.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was holding the lantern up to the length of
her arm. In her orange cloak she shone through
the veil of mist, luminous.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; she said, gently, &#8220;why are you sitting
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because there isn&#8217;t any use in going on.&#8221;</p>

<p>She lowered the lantern so that it shone on his
face. What she saw there frightened her. &#8220;Are
you feeling this way because of me?&#8221; she asked in
a shaking voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because of everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Evans, I won&#8217;t go to the Townes if you want
me to stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked up at her as she bent above him with
the lantern. She seemed to shine within and without,
like some celestial visitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you stay, Jane, if I wanted it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood up. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want it. Not really.
I&#8217;m not quite such a selfish pig,&#8221; his smile was
ghastly.</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment, then she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m
going home with you, Evans. Wait until I tell
Sophy to send Briggs after me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tried to protest, but she was firm. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be
back in a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>She returned presently, the lantern in one hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and her slipper bag in the other. &#8220;I put on heavier
shoes. I should ruin my slippers.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they trod the path together, the light of the
lantern shone in round spots of gold, now in front
of them, now behind them. The fog pressed close,
but the path was clear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Evans,&#8221; said Jane, &#8220;I want you to promise me
something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything, except&mdash;not to love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has nothing to do with love of me, but it has
something to do with love of God.&#8221;</p>

<p>He knew how hard it was for her to say that.
Jane did not speak easily of such things.</p>

<p>She went on with some hesitation. Her
voice, muffled by the fog, had a muted note of
music.</p>

<p>&#8220;Evans, you mustn&#8217;t let what I do make you or
break you. Whether I love you or not, you must
go on. You&mdash;you couldn&#8217;t hold me if you weren&#8217;t
strong enough, even if I was your wife. And there
is strength in you, if you&#8217;ll only believe it. Oh,
you must believe it, Evans. And you mustn&#8217;t make
me feel responsible. I can&#8217;t stand it. To feel all
the time that I am hurting&mdash;you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was sobbing. A little incoherent.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you <i>are</i> captain of your soul, Evans. You.
Not anyone else. I can&#8217;t be. I can be a help, and
oh, I will help all I can. You know that. But&mdash;I
love you like a big brother&mdash;not in any other
way. If anything should happen to you, it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
be dreadful for me, just as it would be dreadful if
anything happened to Baldy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Janey, my dear, don&#8217;t,&#8221; for she was clinging to
his arm, crying as if her heart would break.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I do care for you so much, Evans. I was
frantic when your mother telephoned. I wasn&#8217;t
quite dressed and I made Sophy get the lantern,
and then I ran down the path, and looked for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped and laid his hand on her shoulder.
Her weakness, her broken words had roused in him
a sudden protective tenderness.</p>

<p>&#8220;My little girl,&#8221; he said, &#8220;don&#8217;t. God helping
me, I&#8217;m going to get back. And you are going to
light my way. Jane, do you know when I saw
you coming towards me with that dim lantern it
seemed symbolic. Hope held out to me&mdash;seen
through a fog, faintly. But a light, nevertheless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Evans, if I could love you, I would, you
know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know. You&#8217;d tie up the broken wings of
every bird. You&#8217;d give crutches to the lame, and
food to the hungry. And that&#8217;s the way you feel
about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had let her go now, and they stood apart,
shrouded in ghostly white.</p>

<p>&#8220;God helping me,&#8221; he said again, &#8220;I&#8217;ll get back.
That&#8217;s a promise, Janey, and here&#8217;s my hand upon
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave him her hand. &#8220;God helping us both,&#8221;
she said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>He lifted her hand and kissed it. Then, in silence,
they walked on, until they reached the
house....</p>

<p>The Towne car was waiting, and Mrs. Follette
in a flurry welcomed them. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you
didn&#8217;t ride over with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He hadn&#8217;t come, and we preferred to
walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the matter with you, Evans?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing much, Mother. I&#8217;m sorry you were
fussed.&#8221; He gave her no further explanation.</p>

<p>Jane put on her slippers and went off in the
great car. And then Evans said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going over
to Hallam&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you well, my dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to talk to him.&#8221; He saw her anxious
look, and bent and kissed her. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,
Mumsie, I&#8217;m all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Hallam&#8217;s old estate adjoined the Follette
farm. The doctor was a nerve specialist, and went
every morning to Washington, coming back at
night to the quiet of his charming home. He was
unmarried and was looked after by men-servants.
He had been much interested in Evans&#8217; case, and
had in fact had charge of it.</p>

<p>The doctor was by the library fire, smoking a
cigar and reading a brown book. He welcomed
Evans heartily. &#8220;I was wondering when you
would turn up again.&#8221; He showed the title of his
book, &#8220;Boswell. There was a man. As great as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the man he wrote about, and we are just beginning
to find it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rare edition?&#8221; Evans sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Got it at Lowdermilk&#8217;s yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve oodles of old books on our shelves.
Ought to sell them, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t sell one of mine.&#8221; Hallam was emphatic.
&#8220;I&#8217;d rather murder a baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>Evans flamed suddenly. &#8220;I&#8217;d sell mine, if I
could get the things I want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want anything as much as I want my
books.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do. I want life as I used to live it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor sat up and looked at him. &#8220;You
mean before the war?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired of being half a man. If there&#8217;s any
way out of it, I want you to tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor&#8217;s eyes were bright with interest. He
knew the first symptoms of recovery in such cases.
The neurasthenic quality of Evans&#8217; trouble had
robbed him of initiative. His waking-up was a
promising sign.</p>

<p>&#8220;The thing to do, of course, is to get to work.
Why don&#8217;t you open an office?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A fat chance I&#8217;d have of getting clients.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think they&#8217;d come.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor smoked for a time in silence, then
he said, &#8220;Decide on something hard to do, and do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
it. Do it if you feel you are going to die in the
attempt.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something inspiring to Evans in the
idea. Hard things. That was it. He poured out
the story of the past few days. The awful scene
with Rusty. To-night in the fog under the pines.
&#8220;Wanted more than anything to drop myself in
the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was walking the floor, back and forth, limping
to one edge of the rug, then limping to the
other. &#8220;Then Jane came. Little Jane Barnes.
You know her, and she told me&mdash;where to get off&mdash;said
I was&mdash;captain of my soul&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He
stopped in front of the doctor, and smiled whimsically.
&#8220;Are any of us captains of our souls, doctor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be darned if I know.&#8221; The doctor was intensely
serious. &#8220;Will power has a lot to do with
things. The trouble is when your will won&#8217;t
work&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine seems to be working on one cylinder.&#8221;
Again Evans was pacing the rug. &#8220;But that idea
of an office appeals to me. It will take a bit of
money, though. And it is rather a problem to
know where to get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sell some of the old books. I&#8217;ll buy them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Light leaped into Evans&#8217; eyes. &#8220;It would be
one way, wouldn&#8217;t it? Mother would rather hate it.
But what&#8217;s a library against a life?&#8221; He seemed to
fling the question to a listening universe.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>The doctor laughed. &#8220;She&#8217;ll be sensible if you
put it up to her. And you must frivol a bit. Play
around with the girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want any girls except Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Jane Barnes. Well, she&#8217;ll do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say she will.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor, watching him as he walked back
and forth, said, &#8220;The thing to do is to map out a
normal day. Make it pretty close to the program
you followed before the war. You haven&#8217;t happened
to keep a diary, have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s a clumsy record. Mother started
me when I was a kid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what we want. Read it every night, and
do some of the things the next day that you did
then. You will find you can stick closer than you
think. And it will give you a working plan.&#8221;</p>

<p>Evans sat down and discussed the idea. It was
late when he rose to leave.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be slow,&#8221; was Hallam&#8217;s final admonition,
&#8220;but I believe you can do it. And when
things go wrong, just honk and I&#8217;ll lend you some
gas,&#8221; his big laugh boomed out, as they stood in
the door together. &#8220;Nasty night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a lantern.&#8221; Evans picked it up from the
porch.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Evans reached home his mother called
from up-stairs, &#8220;I thought you were never coming.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>&#8220;Hallam and I had a lot to talk about.&#8221;</p>

<p>He came running up, and entering her room
found her propped up on her pillows.</p>

<p>Mrs. Follette in bed lost nothing of her dignity.
Her gray hair at night was braided and wound into
a coronet above her serene forehead. She wore
something knitted in white and black about her
shoulders. There was a prayer-book on her bedside
table&mdash;and pineapple posts to her bed. She
had inherited her religion and her furniture from
her ancestors, and she kept them both in order.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said Evans, and stood looking down
at her, &#8220;Hallam wants me to sell some of the old
books and use the money to open an office.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of office?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Law. In town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But are you well enough, Evans?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He says that I am. He says that I must think
that I am well, Mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dearest, don&#8217;t spoil it with doubts. It&#8217;s my
life, Mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a look on his face which she had not
seen since his return. Uplifted, eager. A light in
his eyes, like the light which had shone in the eyes
of a boy.</p>

<p>She found it difficult to speak. &#8220;My dear, the
books are yours. Do as you think best.&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaned over and kissed her, lifting her a bit.
There was energy as well as affection in the quick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
caress. She drew herself away laughing, breathless.
&#8220;How strong you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I? Well, I think I am. And I am going
to conquer the world, Mumsie.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>His exaltation lasted during the reading of the
diary. It was a fat little book, and the pages were
written close in his fine firm script. He found
things between the leaves&mdash;a four-leaved clover
Jane had sent him when he made the football team.
A rose, colorless and dry. Florence Preston had
given it to him.</p>

<p>He dropped the rose in the waste-basket. How
could he ever have thought of Florence? Love
wasn&#8217;t a thing of blue eyes and pale gold hair. It
was a thing of fire and flame and fighting.</p>

<p>Fighting! That was it. With your back to the
wall&mdash;and winning!</p>

<p>For some day he meant to win Jane. Did she
think she could be in the world and not be his?
And if she loved strength she should have it. He
bent his head in his hands&mdash;his hands clasped
tensely. There was a prayer in his heart. His
whole being ached with the agony of his effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, God, let me fight and win. Bring me back
to the full measure of a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he opened the book. Bits of printed verse
dropped out of it. Jane had sent him this, &#8220;<i>One
who never turned his back, but marched breast-forward.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>Well, he had turned his back. That day in the
snow. The thought gripped him. Made him white
and sick. He stood up, praying again in an agony
of mind, &#8220;Bring me back.&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened the book and read of Jane, and of
himself as he had once been. He skipped the record
of his college days, except where he found such
reference as this: &#8220;Little Jane is growing up. She
met me at the station and held out her hand to me.
I used always to kiss her, but this time I didn&#8217;t
dare. She was different somehow, but some day
I&#8217;ll kiss her.&#8221;</p>

<p>And this: &#8220;Jane is rather a darling. But I am
beginning to believe that I like &#8217;em fair.&#8221; That
was when he had a terrible crush on Florence Preston,
whose coloring was blue and gold. But it
hadn&#8217;t lasted, and he had come back to Jane with
a sense of refreshment.</p>

<p>He found at last the pages given over to those
first days after he had been admitted to the Washington
bar, and had hung out his shingle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sat at my desk all the morning. Great bluff.
One client received with great effect of busy-ness.
Had lunch with a lot of fellows&mdash;pancakes and
sausages&mdash;ate an armful. Tea with three dbutantes
at the Shoreham&mdash;peaches. Dance at the
Oakleys&#8217; in Georgetown. Corking time. One
deadly moment when the butler took my overcoat.
Poor people ought not to dance where there are
butlers.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>Remembering that incident, he leaned back in
his chair and laughed. The Oakleys had all the
money in the world, and a background of aristocracy.
Evans&#8217; overcoat was rusty and shiny at the
elbows. The butler, a recent importation from
London, had been imposing in knee-breeches and
many buttons. His manner had been perfect, but
Evans had been aware of the servant&#8217;s scorn of
rustiness and shininess. Then his own good sense
had come to the rescue, and he had gone in and had
danced with as light heels as the rest of them.</p>

<p>He found more than one reference to his poverty.
&#8220;I shall have to stop eating, or I can&#8217;t wear my
evening clothes. And I can&#8217;t afford new ones.
Jane says she hates to have me lose weight&mdash;that
I look big and beautiful now like Michelangelo&#8217;s
David at the Corcoran. I don&#8217;t know whether she
is in earnest. One never knows. Her eyes never
tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>And again: &#8220;If I had money enough, I&#8217;d ask
Jane to marry me. But I can&#8217;t pay for Huyler&#8217;s
and matine tickets. And anyhow, I&#8217;m sure she
wouldn&#8217;t have me. Not right off the bat. We&#8217;re
made for each other all right. And some day, if
she doesn&#8217;t know it, I&#8217;ll make her.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were spring days with Jane. &#8220;Gee, but
it&#8217;s good to be alive. Jane and I walked down to
the glen this morning. Picked wild flowers, dogtooth
violets, hepatica, anemones; and we sang&mdash;with
nobody to hear us. I let out my voice&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the Toreador&#8217;s song, and Jane sat there and looked
and listened, and said when I had finished, &#8216;It&#8217;s
like the opera, Evans.&#8217; I believe she meant it, and
she didn&#8217;t want me to stop.... I felt pretty
fine to have her there, liking it.... Oh, she&#8217;s
a darling. I wanted to tell her, but I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Autumn came: &#8220;Jane and I went to-day to
gather fox grapes. Mother is making jelly and so
is Jane. The vines were a great tangle. Shut in
among them we seemed a thousand miles away
from the world. Jane made herself a wreath of
grape leaves, and looked like a nymph of the woods.
I told her so and she gazed at me with those great
gray eyes of hers and said, &#8216;Evans, when the gods
were young they must have lived like this&mdash;with
grapes for their food, and the birds to sing for
them, and the little wild things of the wood for
company. It would be heavenly, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8217;
She&#8217;s a queer kid. Life with her wouldn&#8217;t be humdrum.
She&#8217;s so intensely herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We talked a bit about the war. I told her I
should go if France needed me. I am not going
to wait until this country gets into it. We owe a
debt to France....&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped there, and closed the book. He did
not care to read farther. Oh, his debt to France
had been paid. And after that day with Jane
among the tangled vines things had moved faster&mdash;and
faster.</p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t want to think of it....</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>THE ICE PALACE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> evening wrap which Jane wore with her old
white chiffon was of a bright Madonna blue with a
black fur collar. Jane, as has been said, loved clear
color, and when she dyed dingy things she brought
them forth lovely to the eye and tremendously
picturesque.</p>

<p>The first effect on Frederick Towne of her bobbed
black head above the fur collar was enchanting. It
was only later that he discovered her shabbiness.
That initial glimpse had, however, shown him what
money could do for her.</p>

<p>Frederick&#8217;s house was a place where polished
floors seemed to dissolve in pools of golden light,
where a grand staircase led up to balconies, where
the ceilings were almost incredibly high, the vistas
almost incredibly remote. Frederick, coming towards
her through those pools of golden light&mdash;blonde,
big and smiling, brought a swift memory of
another blonde and heroic figure, not in evening
clothes&mdash;but in silver armor&mdash;&#8220;Nun sei bedankt,
mein lieber Schwan,&#8221; Lohengrin! That was it.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fat Lohengrin,&#8221; she amended, maliciously.</p>

<p>Unaware of this devastating estimate, Frederick
welcomed her with the air of a Cophetua. He was
unconscious of his attitude of condescension. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
was much attracted, but he knew, of course, that
his interest in her would be a great thing for the
little girl.</p>

<p>And he <i>was</i> interested. A queer thing had happened
to him&mdash;a thing which clashed with all his
theories, broke down the logic of his previous arguments.
He had fallen in love with little Jane
Barnes, at first sight if you please&mdash;like a crude
boy. And he wanted her for his wife. It was an
almost unbelievable situation. There had been so
many women he might have married. Lovelier
women than Jane, wittier, more distinguished,
richer&mdash;of more assured social standing. He could
have had the pick of them, yet not one of them had
he wanted. Here was little Jane Barnes, bobbed
hair, boyish, slender, quaint in her cheap clothes,
and he could see no one else at the head of his
table, no one else by his side in the big car, no one
else to share the glamorous days of honeymoon,
and the life which was to follow.</p>

<p>He had always had his own way, and he intended
to have it now. Edith had, of course,
thwarted him in some things, and she was still on
his hands. Yet the matter would, without doubt,
right itself. There were other eligible suitors; it
was not to be supposed that a beauty and an heiress
would remain long unwed.</p>

<p>And in the meantime, he would set himself to the
wooing of Jane. The end was, of course, inevitable.
But Jane would not fall into his arms at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
first word. Her attitude towards him was absolutely
impersonal. She had no blushes, no small
flirtatious tricks. She was as cool as some lovely
garden flower with the morning dew upon it. But
he fancied she might flame.</p>

<p>And so when young Baldwin had telephoned of
Edith&#8217;s plans, there had leaped into Towne&#8217;s mind
the realization of his opportunity. He would see
Jane among his household gods. And he would
see her alone. He had sent Briggs in time to have
her there before the others arrived.</p>

<p>And now Fate had played further into his hands.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve had another message from Edith,&#8221; he told
her; &#8220;we&#8217;ll have to eat dinner without them. The
fog caught them south of Alexandria, and they
went into a ditch. They will eat at the nearest
hotel while the car is being fixed up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Baldy&#8217;s car always breaks at psychological moments,&#8221;
said Jane. &#8220;If it hadn&#8217;t broken down on
the bridge, he wouldn&#8217;t have found your niece.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I wouldn&#8217;t have known you&#8221;&mdash;he was
smiling at her. &#8220;Who would ever have believed
that so much hung on so little.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now Waldron, the butler, announced dinner&mdash;and
Jane entering the dining-room felt dwarfed
by the Gargantuan tables, the high-backed ecclesiastical
chairs, the tall silver candlesticks with
their orange candles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your color,&#8221; Towne told her. &#8220;You see I remembered
your knitting&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;m crazy about brilliant wools,&#8221; said Jane;
&#8220;some day I am going to open a shop and sell
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he knew that she would not open a shop.
&#8220;You were like some lovely bird,&mdash;an oriole, perhaps,
with your orange and black.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dye things,&#8221; said Jane, frankly; &#8220;you should
see some of my clothes when they come out. Joseph&#8217;s
coat isn&#8217;t in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frederick liked her frankness. He knew people
who would have been ashamed to admit their poverty
before Waldron and the maids. To Jane, servants
had neither eyes nor ears&mdash;in that she showed
her accustomedness. People who had never been
served were self-conscious.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next time you see this dress,&#8221; Jane was
saying, &#8220;it will be as blue as my coat. And I&#8217;ll
have a girdle of copper ribbon, and Baldy will paint
my shoes with copper paint.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled at him with her chin tilted in her
bird-like way. She was really having the time of
her life. She was thrilled and fascinated by the
beauty of her surroundings, and gradually Frederick
began to take on something of the fascination.</p>

<p>Against his own background, he showed at his
best. Without one word of fulsome flattery, he
made little Jane feel that she was an honored guest.
He talked extremely well, and though she was alone
with him put her absolutely at her ease.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>The food was delicious. There had been a celestial
canape, a heavenly soup, fish that were pale
pink and smothered in tartare sauce.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is awfully nice,&#8221; Jane told herself out of
her supreme content, as Waldron passed squabs on
a silver platter. She referred of course to Towne
and not to Waldron but, remembering her own old
Sophy&#8217;s shortcomings, she found time, also, to commend
to herself the butler&#8217;s expertness.</p>

<p>After dinner they sat in the great drawing-room&mdash;a
portentous place&mdash;with low-hung crystal chandeliers&mdash;pale
rugs&mdash;pale walls&mdash;with one corner
redeemed from the general chilliness by a fireplace
of yellow Italian marble, and a huge screen of peacock
feathers in a mahogany frame.</p>

<p>&#8220;I call this room the Ice Palace,&#8221; Frederick told
her. &#8220;Mother furnished it in the early eighties&mdash;and
she would never change it. And now I rather
hate to have it different. I warmed this corner
with the fireplace and the screen. Edith always
sits in the library on the other side of the hall, but
Mother and I had our coffee here, and I prefer to
continue the old custom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane&#8217;s eyes opened wide. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you and your
niece drink your coffee together?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Usually, but there have been times,&#8221; he laughed
as he said it, &#8220;when each of us has sat on opposite
sides of the hall in lonely state.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane laughed too. &#8220;Baldy and I do things like
that.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>&#8220;And now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we can talk about Edith.
I suppose I&#8217;ll have to kill the fatted calf. That&#8217;s
what your brother said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds like Baldy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it? Well, he told me the thing that decided
her was some friends who came out and saw
her in the dining-room. She&#8217;s been all the time
with Martha, her mother&#8217;s old cook, whose husband
keeps a country hotel beyond Alexandria. And
Adelaide Laramore and Eloise Harper and a couple
of men were lunching there. I am sorry it happened.
Eloise is a regular town-crier. She&#8217;ll tell
the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>He beat his fist against the arm of his chair. &#8220;I
hate to have the thing in the papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will soon die down,&#8221; said Jane, &#8220;when she
comes home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be glad to have her. But I don&#8217;t quite
see why I am to kill the fatted calf. She won&#8217;t act
in the least like a prodigal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should you care how she acts? You want
her back. Isn&#8217;t that enough?&#8221;</p>

<p>He liked her crisp common sense. Her fearless
expression of opinion. Most of the women he knew
were afraid not to agree with him. That was the
trouble with Adelaide. She leaned to him always
like a lily, charming, feminine, soft as milk. But
Jane did not lean. She was, he told himself, a cup
of elixir held to his lips. He drank as it were of
her youth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>They finished their coffee and he smoked a cigar.
Edith and Baldy telephoned that the thing was
more serious than they had anticipated. That perhaps
he had better send Briggs.</p>

<p>&#8220;So that means I&#8217;m going to have you to
myself for an hour longer,&#8221; Frederick told Jane.
&#8220;I hope you are as happy in the prospect as I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am having a joyous time. I feel like Cinderella
at the ball.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed at that. &#8220;You&#8217;re a refreshing child,
Jane.&#8221; He had never before called her by her first
name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I? But I&#8217;m not a child. I&#8217;m as old as the
hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In wisdom. I know how to make ends meet,
and how to order meals, and how to plan my own
dresses, and a lot of things that your Edith doesn&#8217;t
have to think about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet you are happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed but did not continue the subject.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve a rather wonderful collection of earrings.
Would you like to look at them? Queer fad, isn&#8217;t
it? But I&#8217;ve picked them up everywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why earrings?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Other things are commonplace&mdash;brooches, necklaces,
tiaras. But there&#8217;s romance in the jewels
that women have worn in their ears. You&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went into another room and brought back a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
tray. It was lined with velvet and the earrings
were set up on tiny cushions. It was a unique display.
Cameos from ancient Rome, acorns of human
hair in the horrible taste of the sixties&mdash;gypsy
hoops of gold&mdash;coral roses in delicate fretted
wreaths&mdash;old French jewels&mdash;rubies, emeralds,
sapphires, and seed pearls, larger pearls set alone
to show their beauty, and a sparkling array of
modern things, diamonds in platinum&mdash;long pendants
of jade and jet&mdash;opals dripping like liquid
fire along slender chains.</p>

<p>She hung over them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which do you like best?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pearls?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was doubtful. &#8220;Not the white ones.
These&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he picked up a pair of sapphires set in
seed pearls&mdash;rather barbaric things that hung
down for an inch or more. &#8220;They&#8217;ll suit your
style. Have you ever worn earrings?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try them.&#8221;</p>

<p>He helped her to adjust them&mdash;and his hand
touched her smooth warm cheek. He was conscious
of her closeness, but gave no sign.</p>

<p>There was a little mirror above the mantel.
&#8220;Look at yourself,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>She tilted her head so that the jewels shook.
The blue lights of the stones made her skin incandescent.</p>

<p>Frederick surveyed her critically. &#8220;You ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
to have a more sophisticated gown. Silver brocade
with a wisp of a train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It changes me, doesn&#8217;t it? I am not sure that
I like them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do. Edith has always wanted those earrings.
But I won&#8217;t let her have them. I am saving them
for&mdash;my wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to have wives to wear them&mdash;like
Solomon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that you are recommending it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not. Only one woman couldn&#8217;t ever
wear them all, could she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She might.&#8221; Again he was pleased by her lack
of self-consciousness. What a joy she was after
Adelaide.</p>

<p>As if the name had brought her, a voice spoke
from the door. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t let Waldron announce
me, Ricky; may I come in?&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped as she saw Jane. &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re not
alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Miss Barnes, Adelaide. I think you
met her brother to-day at luncheon. Edith telephoned
that you and Eloise had found her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I came about, to warn you. Eloise
has the reporters on her trail. She&#8217;ll be over in a
minute. But the harm will be done, I am afraid,
before you can stop her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m resigned. Edith&#8217;s coming back to-night.
Miss Barnes&#8217; brother is bringing her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; Adelaide Laramore was appraising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Jane. A shabby child. From the threshold she had
had a moment of jealousy. But the moment was
past. Frederick was extremely fastidious. He
adored beauty and this Barnes child was not beautiful.</p>

<p>What Mrs. Laramore failed to see was that
Jane&#8217;s beauty was of a very special kind. It was
not standardized. It was not marcelled and cold-creamed,
and rouged and powdered. But it had
to do with lighted-up eyes, with youth and a free
spirit. And it was these things in her which had
attracted Frederick.</p>

<p>Jane was unfastening the earrings. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t
they heavenly, Mrs. Laramore?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sapphires?&#8221; Mrs. Laramore sat down on
the couch. Her evening wrap slipped back, showing
her white neck. Her fair hair was swept up
from her forehead. She had a long face, with pink
cheeks and pencilled eyebrows. She was like a portrait
on porcelain, and she knew it, and emphasized
the effect. &#8220;The sapphires? Yes. They&#8217;re the
choice of the lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went on to speak of Eloise. &#8220;She is simply
hopeless. She has told the most hectic tales and
all the papers have sent men out to the Inn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they escaped. They started early and
have been hung up at Alexandria.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eloise and Benny and the Captain dined with
me. She was still telephoning when I left. I told
her that I did not sanction it, and that I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
come straight over and tell you. But she laughed
and said she didn&#8217;t care. That she thought it was
great fun and that you were a good sport.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t see her,&#8221; shortly; &#8220;she ought to know
better. Setting reporters on Edith like a pack of
wolves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told her how you would feel,&#8221; Adelaide reiterated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should see her if I were you, Mr. Towne,&#8221;
said a crisp, young voice.</p>

<p>Adelaide turned with a gasp. With her slippered
feet crossed in front of her, Jane looked like
a child. For the first time Mrs. Laramore got a
good view of those candid gray eyes. They had a
queer effect on her. Eyes like that were most uncommon.
Fearless. The girl was not afraid of
Frederick. She was not afraid of anyone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I see her?&#8221; Frederick demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t it just add to her sense of melodrama if
you don&#8217;t? And why should you care? Your niece
is coming home. And that&#8217;s the end of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean,&#8221; Frederick demanded, &#8220;that I am
to carry it off with an air?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane nodded. &#8220;Make comedy of it instead of
tragedy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adelaide slipping out of her wrap was revealed
as elegant and distinguished in silver and black.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I have a cigarette, Ricky, to settle my
nerves? Eloise is tremendously upsetting.&#8221; Adelaide
was plaintive.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>Jane watched her with lively curiosity. The
women she knew did not smoke. Baldy&#8217;s flappers
did, but they were abnormal and of a new generation.
Mrs. Laramore was old enough to be Jane&#8217;s
mother, and Jane had a feeling ... that
mothers ... shouldn&#8217;t smoke....</p>

<p>But none the less, Adelaide Laramore and her
exotic ways were amusing. She had a brittle and
artificial look, like the Manchu lady in the Museum,
or something in wax.</p>

<p>Jane was brought back from her meditation by
the riotous entrance of Eloise and the two men.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew Adelaide was telling tales.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you I was coming, Eloise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eloise stared at Jane when Frederick presented
her. &#8220;You look like your brother. Twins?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Jane decided that she liked Miss Harper
better than she did Mrs. Laramore&mdash;which wasn&#8217;t
saying&mdash;much....</p>

<p>&#8220;The reporters are on their way to Alexandria&mdash;full
cry.&#8221; Eloise all in emerald green, with her
red hair in a classic coiffure, was like some radiant
witch, exultant of evil. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t scold me,
Frederick. It was terribly exciting to tell them,
and I adore excitement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They aren&#8217;t there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>Frederick chanted composedly, &#8220;We three know
... but we will never tell....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Adelaide will, when I get her alone.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>&#8220;I will not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Miss Barnes will. Do you know how
young you look, Miss Barnes? I feel as if you&#8217;d
tell me anything for a stick of candy.&#8221;</p>

<p>They roared at that. And Jane said, &#8220;Nobody
ever made me do anything I didn&#8217;t want to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now Benny and the Captain looked at her,
and looked again. What a voice the child had, and
eyes!</p>

<p>Eloise, on the couch, hugged her knees and surveyed
her gold slippers. &#8220;They are putting my
picture in the paper and Adelaide&#8217;s. They saw
one on my desk&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Laramore cried out, &#8220;Benny, why did you
let her do it?&#8221; and there was a great uproar&mdash;in
which Eloise could be heard saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;And they are going to have a picture of the
Inn, and one of your brother if they can get it,
Miss Barnes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane began to feel uncomfortable. She was, she
told herself, as much out of place as a pussy-cat in
a Zoo. These women and these men reminded her
somehow of the great sleek animals who snarled at
each other in the Rock Creek cages. Frederick did
not snarl. But she had a feeling he might if Eloise
kept at him much longer.</p>

<p>It was in the midst of the hubbub that Edith
entered. She walked in among them as composedly
as she had faced them at the Inn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you sound like a jazz band.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
She went straight up to Frederick and kissed him.
&#8220;I suppose Eloise is shouting the news to the
world.&#8221; She tucked her hand in his arm. &#8220;There
are more than a million reporters outside. Mr.
Barnes is keeping them at bay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did they find you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heard of us, I suppose, at the Alexandria hotel.
We didn&#8217;t realize it until we reached here, and then
they piled out and began to ask questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frederick lifted her hand from his arm. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
go and send them away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eloise jumped up. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then Frederick snarled, &#8220;Stay here.&#8221;</p>

<p>But neither of them went, for Baldy entered,
head cocked, eyes alight&mdash;Jane knew the signs.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve gone,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I told you I&#8217;d get
rid of them, Miss Towne.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded to them all. Absolutely at his ease,
lifted above them all by the exaltation of his mood.
Finer, Jane told herself, than any of them&mdash;his
beautiful youth against their world-weariness.</p>

<p>Edith was smiling at Jane. &#8220;I knew you at
once. You are like your brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were alike. A striking pair as they stood
together. &#8220;It is because of Mr. Barnes and his
sister that we got in touch with Edith,&#8221; Frederick
explained. He had regained his genial manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, really.&#8221; Adelaide knew that she and her
friends ought to go at once. Edith looked tired,
and Eloise at moments like this was impossible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
But she hated to leave anyone else in the field.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t I give you a lift?&#8221; she asked Jane, sweetly,
&#8220;you and your brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was Frederick who answered. &#8220;Miss
Barnes lives at Sherwood Park. Briggs will take
her out.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Adelaide went away, and Eloise and the two
men, and Edith turned to her uncle and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m
sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face was white and her eyes were shining,
and all of a sudden she reached up her arms and
put them about his neck and sobbed as if her heart
would break.</p>

<p>And then, and not until then, little Jane knew
that Edith was not like one of the animals at the
Zoo.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>JANE POURS TEA</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> Jane&#8217;s next letter to Judy she told her how
the evening with the Townes had ended.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Edith insisted that I should stay all night.
She&#8217;s a perfect darling, so absolutely and utterly
exquisite, and yet so human. She and her uncle
simply can&#8217;t look at things from the same angle.
And they are both to blame. Anything sets them
off,&mdash;you should have seen them&mdash;like people in a
play.</p>

<p>&#8220;I slept in the spare room&mdash;and well, I lay
awake half the night looking at it, and admiring
myself in one of Edith&#8217;s nighties! I never saw
such underthings, Judy! For a princess! Her
room is all rose and silver and ivory, and the room
I slept in is in pale yellow&mdash;with a canopy to my
bed of gold brocade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Edith and I had breakfast together. Everything
brought up on a tray and set in her little
sitting-room, and we wore lace caps and breakfast
coats, and looked&mdash;superlative! Edith is the most
beautiful person&mdash;like one of the Viking women&mdash;with
her hair in thick fair braids. I told her that,
and she laughed. &#8216;What a pair of poets you are,&#8217;
she said, &#8216;you and your brother.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was good to hear her laugh. She cried
dreadfully the night before. Coming back was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
hard for her&mdash;and then Mr. Towne got on her
nerves. They both wanted me to stay, and Baldy
stayed, too, and I know his head bumped the clouds.
And this morning on his way to the office, he
bought a bunch of heliotrope for Edith and sent it
up to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;The trouble with Edith is that her life hasn&#8217;t
been <i>real</i>, Judy. Not in the way that your life and
mine and Baldy&#8217;s is real. She has never had any
work to do, and nothing has ever depended upon
her. Think of it. There&#8217;s no reason why she
can&#8217;t stay in bed all day if she wants to. And she
can gratify any mood of the moment. The consequence
is that half the time she is bored stiff. She
says that was the reason she became engaged to
Delafield Simms. Anything for a change.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks as if she and I were going to be frightfully
friendly. She told me that she wants me for
a friend. That Eloise Harper and her kind are
horrible to her after the things that have happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow afternoon she and her uncle are
coming out here to tea, and I&#8217;m going to have the
Follettes over. Mrs. Follette will love it. But
Evans won&#8217;t. He doesn&#8217;t like Mr. Towne.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, my dearest-dear, I am worried about
that hint in your last letter that you are not well.
Take care of yourself, and remember I have only
one precious sister, and the kiddies have only one
mother. We need you in our young lives, and you
mustn&#8217;t work too hard.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>When she had written the last line, Jane sat
very still at her desk. She was thinking of Evans.
She hadn&#8217;t seen him for three days. Not since the
Sunday night she had gone to the Townes. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
night in the fog had impressed her strangely. She
had felt for Evans something that had nothing to
do with admiration for him nor respect nor charm.
His weakness had drawn her to him, as a mother
might be drawn to a child. His struggle was, she
felt, something which she must share. Not as his
wife! No.... That kind of love was different.
If only he would let her be his little sister,
Jane.</p>

<p>He had not even called her up. When she had
invited him and his mother to tea with the Townes,
Mrs. Follette had answered, and had accepted for
both of them. Evans, she said, was in Washington,
and would be out on the late train.</p>

<p>When he arrived ahead of the others on the afternoon
of her tea, Jane said, &#8220;Where have you been?
Do you know it has been four days since we&#8217;ve seen
each other?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Weren&#8217;t you glad to get rid of me? I&#8217;ve
thought of you every minute.&#8221; He dropped into a
seat beside her.</p>

<p>She was gazing at him with lively curiosity.
&#8220;How nice you look.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;New suit. Like it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. And you act as if somebody had left you
a million dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wish he had. I bought this outfit with a first
edition &#8216;Alice in Wonderland,&#8217;&#8221; he laughed and
explained. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been getting rid of some of our
rare books. I feel plutocratic in consequence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Five hundred dollars, if you please, for that old
Hogarth, with the scathing Ruskin inscription.
And I&#8217;m going to open an office, Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In Washington?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On Connecticut Avenue. Same building, same
room, where I started.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Evans, how splendid!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. You did it, Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I? How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The night of the fog. I never realized before
what a walking-stick I&#8217;ve been&mdash;leaning on you.
Henceforth you&#8217;re the Lady of the Lantern. It
won&#8217;t be so fatiguing.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was smiling at her, and she smiled back. Yet
quite strangely and inconsistently, she felt as if
in changing his attitude towards her, he had robbed
her of some privilege. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mind being a
walking-stick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I minded. After this I&#8217;ll walk alone.
And I&#8217;m going to work hard, and play around a
bit. Will you have tea with me to-morrow, Jane?
At the Willard? To celebrate my first tottering
steps.&#8221;</p>

<p>She agreed, eagerly. &#8220;It will be like old times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Minus a lot, old lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was the way he had talked to her years
ago. The plaintive note was gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take the three-thirty train and I&#8217;ll meet you.
I&#8217;ll pay for the taxi with what&#8217;s left of &#8216;Alice.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too extravagant.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>&#8220;Nothing is too good for you, Jane. I can&#8217;t say
it as I want to say it, but you&#8217;ll never know what
you seemed to me on Sunday as you came through
the mist.&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice shook a little, but he recovered himself
in a moment. &#8220;Here come the Townes.&#8221; He
rose as Edith entered with young Baldwin.</p>

<p>After that Evans followed Baldy&#8217;s lead as a dispenser
of hospitality. The two of them passed
cups, passed thin bread and butter, passed little
cakes, passed lemon and cream and sugar, flung
conversational balls as light as feathers into the
air, were, as Baldy would have expressed it, &#8220;the
life of the party.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something must have gone to Casabianca&#8217;s
head,&#8221; Frederick Towne remarked to Jane. &#8220;Have
you ever seen him like this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Years ago. He was tremendously attractive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you find him attractive now?&#8221; with a touch
of annoyance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I find him&mdash;wonderful&#8221;&mdash;her tone was defiant&mdash;&#8220;and
I&#8217;ve known him all my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had known me all your life would you
call me wonderful?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him from behind her battlements
of silver. &#8220;How do I know? People have to prove
themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Hallam had driven Mrs. Follette over. He
rarely did social stunts, but he liked Jane. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
he had been interested enough in Evans to want to
glimpse him in his new rle.</p>

<p>Strolling up to the tea-table, he was aware at
once of a situation which might make for comedy,
or indeed for tragedy. It was evident that Towne
was much attracted to little Jane Barnes. If Jane
reciprocated, what of young Follette?</p>

<p>Hallam knew Towne, and himself a bachelor of
quite another type, without vanity where women
were concerned, he had a feeling of contempt
for a man whose reputation was linked with a
long line of much-talked about ladies. And now
little Jane was the reigning queen. He didn&#8217;t
like the idea of her youth, and Towne&#8217;s late
forties.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw Mrs. Laramore yesterday,&#8221; he said,
abruptly, &#8220;lovely as ever&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course.&#8221; Towne wished that Hallam
wouldn&#8217;t talk about Adelaide. He wished that all
of the others would go away and leave him alone
with Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Laramore,&#8221; said Jane unexpectedly,
&#8220;makes me think of the lady of Shallott. I don&#8217;t
know why. But I do. I have really never seen
such a beautiful woman. But she doesn&#8217;t seem
real. I have a feeling that if anything hit her, she&#8217;d
break like china.&#8221;</p>

<p>They laughed at her, and Edith said, &#8220;Adelaide
will never break. She&#8217;ll melt. She&#8217;s as soft as
wax.&#8221; Then pigeonholing Mrs. Laramore for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
more vital matters. &#8220;Uncle Fred, I am going out
to Baldy&#8217;s studio; he&#8217;s painting Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frederick was at once interested. &#8220;Her portrait?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. A sketch for a magazine competition,&#8221;
Baldy explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I see it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Baldy, yearning for solitude and Edith, gave reluctant
consent. &#8220;Come on, everybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>So everybody, including Dr. Hallam and Mrs.
Follette, made their way to the garage.</p>

<p>Edith and young Baldwin arrived first. &#8220;And
this is where you work,&#8221; she said, softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Look here, will you sit here so that I can
feast my eyes on you? I&#8217;ve dreamed of you in that
chair&mdash;in classic costume. Do you know that you
were made for a goddess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that you are a romantic boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet as she sat in the garden seat which he had
transformed into a throne for her by throwing a
rug over it and setting it up above the others on a
small platform, she sighed a little.</p>

<p>Here in this small room he spent his spare moments.
He looked out through that small square
window on the rains and snow, and the young green
of the spring&mdash;and he tried to paint his dreams,
yet was held back because he was chained to the
galley of a Government job. And if he was not
chained, what might he not do? If someone waved
a wand and set him free? And if the someone who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
waved a wand loved him? Inspired him? Might
he not give to the world some day a masterpiece?
Well, why not? She found herself thrilling
with the thought. To be a torch and light the
way!</p>

<p>&#8220;How old are you?&#8221; she asked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-five.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it. I&#8217;m twenty-two, and I feel a
thousand years older than you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will always be&mdash;ageless.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed. &#8220;How old is Jane?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty. Yet people take us for twins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t look it and neither do you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The others came in and Edith went back to her
thoughts. He wasn&#8217;t too young. She was glad of
that....</p>

<p>The sketch of Jane was on an easel. There she
stood, a slender figure in her lilac frock&mdash;bobbed
black hair, lighted-up eyes&mdash;the lifted basket with
its burden of gold and purple and green!</p>

<p>Towne stood back and looked at it. Jane at his
side said, &#8220;That&#8217;s some of the fruit you sent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; Frederick had no eyes for anything
but Jane, in her lilac frock. Jove, but the boy had
caught the spirit of her!</p>

<p>He turned to Baldy. &#8220;It is most unusual. And
I want it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; said Baldy, crisply. &#8220;I am sending it
off to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much is the prize?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>&#8220;Two thousand dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will write a check for that amount if you
will let me have this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I can&#8217;t, Mr. Towne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I feel this way about it. It isn&#8217;t worth
two thousand dollars. But if I win the prize it
may be worth that to the magazine&mdash;the advertising
and all that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that splitting hairs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps, but it&#8217;s the way I feel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if you don&#8217;t win the prize you won&#8217;t have
anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll be out two thousand dollars.&#8221; The
lion in the Zoo was snarling.</p>

<p>And above him, breathing an upper air, was this
young eagle. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad to give the sketch to
you if it comes back,&#8221; said Baldy, coolly, &#8220;but I
rather think it will stick.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was, in a way, a dreadful moment for Towne.
There was young Baldwin sitting on the edge of
the table, swinging a leg, debonair, defiant. And
Edith laughing in her sleeve. Frederick knew that
she was laughing. He was as red as a turkey cock.</p>

<p>It was Jane who saved him from apoplexy. She
was really inordinately proud of Baldy, but she
knew the dangers of his mood. And she had her
duties as hostess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Baldy wants to see himself on the news stands,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
she said, soothingly; &#8220;don&#8217;t deprive him of that
pleasure, Mr. Towne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing of the kind, Jane,&#8221; exclaimed her
brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Baldy, I won&#8217;t quarrel with you before people.
We must reserve that pleasure until we are alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not quarrelling.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane held up a protesting hand. &#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s run
away from him, Mr. Towne. When he begins like
that, there&#8217;s no end to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She carried Frederick back to the house, and
Evans, looking after them, said vindictively to Hallam,
&#8220;Old Midas got his that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Hallam chuckled. &#8220;You don&#8217;t hate him, do
you? Evans, don&#8217;t let him have Jane. He isn&#8217;t
worth it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither am I,&#8221; said Evans. &#8220;But I would
know better how to make her happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Back once more in the bright little living-room,
Towne said to Jane, &#8220;May I have another cup of
tea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care. I like to see you pour it with
your lovely hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spread her hands out on the shining mahogany
of the tea-table. &#8220;Are they lovely? Nobody
ever told me.&#8221;</p>

<p>His hand went over hers. &#8220;The loveliest in the
world.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat there in a moment&#8217;s breathless silence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Then she drew her hands away. Touched a little
bell. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have Sophy bring us some hot water.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sophy came and went. Jane poured hot tea with
flushed cheeks.</p>

<p>He took the cup when she handed it to him.
&#8220;Dear child, you&#8217;re not offended?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a child, Mr. Towne.&#8221; Her lashes were
lowered, her cheeks flushed.</p>

<p>He put his cup down and leaned towards her.
&#8220;You are more than a child to me&mdash;a beloved
woman. Jane, you needn&#8217;t be afraid of me....
I want you for my wife!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her astonished eyes met his. &#8220;But we haven&#8217;t
known each other a week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t love you more if I had known you a
thousand years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Towne&mdash;please.&#8221; He was very close to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kiss me, Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>She held her slender figure away from him.
&#8220;You must not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, really.... Please,&#8221; she was breathing
quickly. &#8220;Please.&#8221; She was on her feet, the
tea-table between them.</p>

<p>He saw his mistake. &#8220;Forgive me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her candid eyes met his. &#8220;Mr. Towne, would
you have acted like this ... with Edith&#8217;s
friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>Edith&#8217;s friends! The child&#8217;s innocence! Adelaide&#8217;s
kisses went for a song. Eloise frankly offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
hers. Edith was saved by only some inner
grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane, they are not worth your little finger. I
put you above all. On a pedestal. Honestly. And
I want you to marry me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make you. I have everything to give you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Had he? What of Robin Hood and Galahad?
What of youth and youth&#8217;s audacity, high resolves,
flaming dreams?</p>

<p>She felt something of this subconsciously. But
she would not have been a feminine creature had
she not felt the flattery of his pursuit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane, I&#8217;ll make life a fairy tale. We&#8217;ll travel
everywhere. Sail strange seas. Wouldn&#8217;t you love
it&mdash;all those countries you have never seen&mdash;and
just the two of us? And all the places you have
read about? And when we come home I&#8217;ll build
you a house&mdash;wherever you say&mdash;with a great garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was eloquent, and the things he promised
were woven into the woof of all her girlish imaginings.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought not to listen,&#8221; she said, tremulously.</p>

<p>But he knew that she had listened. He was wise
enough to leave it&mdash;there.</p>

<p>He rose as he heard the others coming back.
&#8220;Will you ride with me to-morrow afternoon?
Don&#8217;t be afraid of me. I&#8217;ll promise to be good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry. I&#8217;m to have tea in town with Evans.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you break the engagement?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t break engagements.&#8221; The cock of her
head was like Baldy&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t. Some day you&#8217;ll be breaking
them for me.&#8221; But he liked her independence. It
promised much that would be stimulating. And
he would always be the Conqueror. He liked to
think that he would be&mdash;the Conqueror.</p>

<p>So he went away secure in the thought of Jane&#8217;s
final surrender. There was everything in it for her,
and the child must see it. Her hesitation was natural.
She couldn&#8217;t, of course, come at the first
crook of his finger. But she would come.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>A TELEGRAM</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Janey&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Baldy.&#8221; Jane sat up in bed, dreams still in
her eyes. She had been late in getting to sleep.
There had been so much to think of&mdash;Frederick
Towne&#8217;s proposal&mdash;the startling change in
Evans&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a telegram. Open the door, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>She caught up her dressing-gown and wrapped it
around her. &#8220;A telegram?&#8221; She was with him
now in the hall. &#8220;Baldy, is it Judy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. She&#8217;s ill. Asks if you can come on and
look after the kiddies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221; She swayed a little. &#8220;Hold on to
me a minute, Baldy. It takes my breath away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t be scared, old girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be all right in ... a minute....&#8221;</p>

<p>His arms were tight about her. &#8220;It seems as if
I should go, too, Janey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t. I&#8217;ll get things ready and ride
in with you in the morning. I&#8217;ll pack my trunk
if you&#8217;ll bring it down from the attic. I can sleep
on the train to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when he had brought it she made him go
back to bed. The house was very still. Merrymaid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
waked by the unusual excitement, came up-stairs
and sat, round-eyed, by Jane, watching her
fold her scant wardrobe and purring a song of consolation.
Jane found time now and then to stop
and smooth the sleek head, and once she picked
Merrymaid up in her arms, and the tears dripped
on the old cat&#8217;s fur.</p>

<p>Philomel sang very early the next morning. It
was Baldy who made the coffee, and who telephoned
Sophy and the Follettes. Mrs. Follette insisted
that Baldy should stay at Castle Manor in Jane&#8217;s
absence. &#8220;It will do Evans good, and we&#8217;d love to
have him.&#8221;</p>

<p>So that was settled. And Evans came over while
the young people were breakfasting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about anything,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Baldy
and I will look after the chickens&mdash;and take the
little cats over to Castle Manor. I&#8217;ll wrap them
all in cotton wool rather than have anything happen
to them. So don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>

<p>The thing she worried about was Judy. &#8220;She
told me in one of her letters that she wasn&#8217;t well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baldy went to bring his car around, and Evans
stood with his hand on the back of Jane&#8217;s chair,
looking down at her. &#8220;You&#8217;ll write to me, Jane?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shifted his hand from the chair back to her
shoulder. &#8220;Dear little girl, if my blundering
prayers will help you any&mdash;you&#8217;ll have them.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned in her chair and looked up at him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
She could not speak. Their eyes met, and once
more Jane had that breathless sense of fluttering
wings within her that lifted to the sun.</p>

<p>Then Baldy was back, and the bags were ready,
and there was just that last hand-clasp. &#8220;God
bless you, Jane....&#8221;</p>

<p>Frederick Towne was at the train. He had been
dismayed at the news of Jane&#8217;s departure. &#8220;Do
you mean that you are going to stay indefinitely?&#8221;
he had asked over the wire.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall stay as long as Judy needs me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frederick had flowers for her, books and a big
box of sweets. People in the Pullman stared at
Jane in the midst of all her magnificence. They
stared too, at Towne, and at Briggs, who rushed in
at the last moment with more books from Brentano.</p>

<p>Edith and Baldy were on the platform. Edith
had come down with Towne. So Frederick, alone
with Jane, said, &#8220;I want you to think of the things
we talked about yesterday&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, not now. Oh, I&#8217;m afraid&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of me? You mustn&#8217;t be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not of you&mdash;of everything&mdash;Life.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her hand and held it. &#8220;Is there anything
else I can do for you? Everything I have
is&mdash;yours, you know&mdash;if you want it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had to leave her then, with a final close clasp
of the hand. She saw him presently standing beside
Baldy on the station platform&mdash;the center of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the eyes of everybody&mdash;the great Frederick
Towne!</p>

<p>As the city slipped away and she leaned her head
against the cushions and looked out at the flying
fields&mdash;it seemed a stupendous thing that a man
like Towne should have laid his fortune at her feet.
Yet she had no sense of exhilaration. She liked
the things he had to offer&mdash;yearned for them&mdash;but
she did not want him at her side.</p>

<p>In her sorrow her heart turned to the boy who
had stumbled over the words, &#8220;If my blundering
prayers will help you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She found herself sobbing&mdash;the first tears she
had shed since the arrival of the telegram.</p>

<p>When she reached Chicago, her brother-in-law,
Bob Heming, met her. &#8220;Judy&#8217;s holding her own,&#8221;
he said, as he kissed her. &#8220;It was no end good of
you to come, Janey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you a nurse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two. Day nurse and night nurse. And a
maid. Judy is nearly frantic about the expense.
It isn&#8217;t good for her, either, to worry. That&#8217;s half
the trouble. I tried to make her get help, but she
wouldn&#8217;t. But I blame myself that I didn&#8217;t insist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t blame yourself, Bob. Judy wouldn&#8217;t.
She told me she could get along. And when Judy
decides a thing, no one can change her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, times have been hard. And business bad.
And Judy knew it. She&#8217;s such a good sport.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were in a taxi, so when tears came into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Heming&#8217;s eyes, he made no effort to conceal
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just about all in. You can&#8217;t understand
how much it means to me to have you here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now that I am here,&#8221; said Jane, with a
gallantry born of his need of her, &#8220;things are going
to be better.&#8221;</p>

<p>The apartment was simply furnished and bore the
stamp of Judy&#8217;s good taste. A friend had taken
the children out to ride, so the rooms were very
quiet as Jane went through them.</p>

<p>Judy in bed was white and thin, and Jane wanted
to weep over her, but she didn&#8217;t. &#8220;You blessed old
girl,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you&#8217;re going to get well right
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The doctor thinks I may have to have an operation.
That&#8217;s why I felt I must wire you.&#8221; Judy
was anxious. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t leave the babies with
strangers. And it was so important that Bob
should be at his work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Jane; &#8220;do you think anything
would have made me stay away?&#8221;</p>

<p>Judy gave a quick sigh of relief. How heavenly
to have Janey! And what a dear she was with her
air of conquering the world. Jane had always been
like that&mdash;with that conquering air. It cheered
one just to look at her.</p>

<p>The babies, arriving presently in a rollicking
state of excitement over the advent of Auntie Jane,
showed themselves delightful and adoring.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>&#8220;Junior,&#8221; said Jane, &#8220;are you glad I&#8217;m here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you bring me anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something&mdash;wonderful&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>She opened her bag, and produced Towne&#8217;s box
of sweets. &#8220;May I give him a chocolate, Judy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One little one, and just a taste for baby. Jane,
where did you get that gorgeous box?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Frederick Towne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really? My dear, your letters have been tremendously
interesting. Haven&#8217;t they, Bob?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her husband nodded. He was sitting by the bedside
holding her hand. &#8220;Towne&#8217;s a pretty big
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a moment of vaingloriousness, Jane wanted
to say to them, &#8220;What do you think of your ugly
duckling? Mr. Towne wants her to be his wife.&#8221;
But of course she didn&#8217;t. Not before Bob. She&#8217;d
tell Judy, later, of course.</p>

<p>The nurse came in then, and Jane went with Bob
and the babies to the dining-room.</p>

<p>Junior over his bread and milk was frankly
critical. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d be so old. Mother
said you&#8217;d play with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can play splendid games, Junior.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you? What kind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s one about a pussy-cat. And I&#8217;m
the big cat and you&#8217;re the little cat&mdash;and my name
is Merrymaid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the little cat&#8217;s name?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to find one. We can&#8217;t just call
him Kitty, can we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we can. My name&#8217;s Kitty, and your name
is Merrymaid, and&mdash;what do we do, Aunt Janey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We drink milk,&#8221; promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; what else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We play with balls&mdash;I&#8217;ll show you after dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to show me now.&#8221;</p>

<p>His father interposed. &#8220;Aunt Janey&#8217;s tired.
Wait till she&#8217;s had her dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Junior drank his milk thoughtfully. &#8220;I&#8217;m a
kitty&mdash;and you&#8217;re a cat. Why don&#8217;t you drink
milk, too, Aunt Janey?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane smiled at Bob. &#8220;Do I have to answer all
his questions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whether you do or not, he&#8217;ll keep on asking.&#8221;</p>

<p>But after dinner, Junior went to sleep in Jane&#8217;s
arms, having been regaled on a rapturous diet of
&#8220;The Three Bears&#8221; and &#8220;The Little Red Hen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re such beauties, Judy,&#8221; said Jane, as she
went back to her sister. &#8220;But they don&#8217;t look like
any of the Barnes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they&#8217;re like Bob, with their white skins and
fair hair. I wanted one of them to have our coloring.
Do you know how particularly lovely you are
getting to be, Janey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Judy, I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you are. And none of us thought it. And
so Mr. Towne wants to marry you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is in your eyes, dear, and in the cock of your
head. You and Baldy always look that way when
something thrilling happens to you. You can&#8217;t
fool me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not in love with him. So that&#8217;s that,
Judy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;it&#8217;s a great opportunity, isn&#8217;t it, Jane?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it is,&#8221; slowly, &#8220;but I can&#8217;t quite see
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s too old for one thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only forty&mdash;&mdash;? Rich men don&#8217;t grow old.
And he could give you everything&mdash;everything,
Janey.&#8221; Judy&#8217;s voice rose a little. &#8220;Jane, you
don&#8217;t know what it means to want things for those
you love and not be able to have them. Bob did
very well until the slump in business. But since
the babies came&mdash;I have worked until&mdash;well, until
it seemed as if I couldn&#8217;t stand it. Bob&#8217;s such a
darling. I wouldn&#8217;t change <i>anything</i>. I&#8217;d marry
him over again to-morrow. But I do know this,
that Frederick Towne could make life lovely for
you, and perhaps you won&#8217;t get another chance to
marry a man like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t&mdash;don&#8217;t.&#8221; It seemed dreadful to Jane
to have Judy talk that way, as if life had in some
way failed her. Life mustn&#8217;t fail, and it wouldn&#8217;t
if one had courage. Judy was sick, and things
didn&#8217;t look straight.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>&#8220;See here, old dear,&#8221; Jane said, &#8220;go to sleep and
stop thinking about how to make ends meet. That&#8217;s
my job, and I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Judy slipping away into refreshing slumber
had that vision before her of Jane&#8217;s young strength&mdash;of
Jane&#8217;s gay young voice like the sound of silver
trumpets....</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>EVANS PLAYS THE GAME</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Life</span> for Evans Follette after Jane went away
became a sort of game in which he played, as he
told himself grimly, a Jekyll and Hyde part. Two
men warred constantly within him. There was
that scarecrow self which nursed mysterious fears,
a gaunt gray-haired self, The Man Who Had Come
Back From the War. And there was that other,
shadowy, elusive, The Boy Who Once Had Been.
And it was the Boy who took on gradually shape
and substance fighting for place with the dark giant
who held desperately to his own.</p>

<p>Yet the Boy had weapons, faith and hope. The
little diary became in a sense a sacred book.
Within its pages was imprisoned something that
beat with frantic wings to be free. Evans, shrinking
from the program which he compelled himself
to follow, was faced with things like this. &#8220;Gee, I
wish the days were longer. I&#8217;d like to dance
through forty-eight hours at a stretch. Jane is
getting to be some little dancer. I taught her the
new steps to-night. She&#8217;s as graceful as a willow
wand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, a man with a limp couldn&#8217;t dance. Or
could he?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>A Thomas Jefferson autograph went therefore to
pay for twenty dancing lessons. Would the great
Democrat turn in his grave? Yet what were ink
scratches made by a dead hand as against all the
meanings of love and life?</p>

<p>Evans bought a phonograph, and new records.
He practised at all hours, to the great edification of
old Mary, who washed dishes and scrubbed floors in
syncopated ecstasies.</p>

<p>He took Baldy and Edith to tea at the big hotels,
and danced with Edith. He apologized, but kept
at it. &#8220;I&#8217;m out of practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edith was sympathetic and interested. She invited
the two boys to her home, where there was a
music room with a magical floor. Sometimes the
three of them were alone, and sometimes Towne
came in and danced too, and Adelaide Laramore
and Eloise Harper.</p>

<p>Towne danced extremely well. In spite of his
avoirdupois he was light on his feet. He exercised
constantly. He felt that if he lost his waist line
all would be over. He could not, however, always
control his appetite. Hence the sugar in his tea,
and other indulgences.</p>

<p>Baldy wrote to Jane of their afternoon frivols.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;You should see us! Eloise Harper dancing
with Evans, and old Towne and his Adelaide! And
Edith and I! We&#8217;re a pretty pair, if I do say it.
We miss you, and always wish you were with us.
Sometimes it seems almost heartless to do things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
that you can&#8217;t share. But it&#8217;s doing a lot for
Evans. Queer thing, the poor old chap goes at it
as if his life depended upon it.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are invited to dine with the Townes on
Christmas Eve. Some class, what? By we, I
mean myself and the Follettes. Edith and Mrs.
Follette see a lot of each other, and Mrs. Follette
is tickled pink! You know how she loves that sort
of thing&mdash;Society with a big S.</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be just our crowd and Mrs. Laramore
for dinner, and after that a big costume ball.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall go as a page in red. And Evans will be
a monk and sing Christmas carols. Edith Towne
is crazy about his voice. He sat down at the piano
one day in the music room, and she heard him.
Jane, his voice is wonderful&mdash;it always was, you
know, but we haven&#8217;t heard it lately. Poor old
chap&mdash;he seems to be picking up. Edith says it
makes her want to cry to see him, but she&#8217;s helping
all she can.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s a dear and a darling, Janey. And I
don&#8217;t know what I am going to do about it. I have
nothing to offer her. But at least I can worship
... I shan&#8217;t look beyond that....</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, little old thing, take care of yourself,
and don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re playing around and forgetting
you, for we&#8217;re not. Even Merrymaid and the kit-cat
look pensive when your name is mentioned.
They share the library hearth with Rusty. The
old fellow is on his feet now, not much the worse
for his accident.</p>

<p>&#8220;Love to Judy and Bob, and the kiddies. And
a kiss or two for my own Janey.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Jane, having read the letter, laid it down with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
sense of utter forlornness. Evans and Eloise
Harper! Towne and his Adelaide! A Christmas
costume ball! Evans singing for Edith Towne!</p>

<p>Evans&#8217; own letters told her little. They were
dear letters, giving her news of Sherwood, full of
kindness and sympathy, full indeed of a certain
spiritual strength&mdash;that helped her in the heavy
days. But he had sketched very lightly his own
activities.&mdash;He had perhaps hesitated to let her
know that he could be happy without her.</p>

<p>But Evans was not happy. He did the things he
had mapped out for himself, but he could not do
them light-heartedly as the Boy had done. For
how could he be light-hearted with Jane away? He
had moments of loneliness so intense that they
almost submerged him. He came therefore upon
one entry in his diary with eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Had a day with the Boy Scouts. Hiked up
through Montgomery County. Caught some little
shiners in the creek and cooked them. Grapes thick
in the Glen. The boys were like small Bacchuses,
and draped themselves in fruit and leaves. They
are fine fellows. I have no patience with people
who look upon boys as nothing but small animals.
Why their dreams! And shy about them! Now
and then they open their hearts to me&mdash;and I can
see the fineness that&#8217;s under the outer crust.
They lie under the trees with me, and we talk as
we follow the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boys&mdash;&mdash;! That was it! He&#8217;d get in touch with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
them again. And he did. There were two, Sandy
Stoddard and Arthur Lane, who came over and sat
by the library fire with Rusty and the two cats, and
popped corn, and wanted to hear about the war.</p>

<p>At first when they spoke of it, Evans would not
talk&mdash;but a moment arrived when he found flaming
words to show them how he felt about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know a lot of fellows,&#8221; said Sandy Stoddard,
&#8220;who say that America wouldn&#8217;t have gone into it
if she&#8217;d known a lot of things. And that most of
the men who came back feel that they were just&mdash;fooled&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If they feel that way, they are fools themselves,&#8221;
said Evans, shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they&#8217;re all throwing bricks at us now,&#8221;
said Sandy. &#8220;France and Great Britain, and the
rest of them. When you read the papers you feel
as if America was pretty punk&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sandy,&#8221; said Evans, slowly, reaching for the
right words because this boy must know the truth&mdash;&#8220;America
is never punk. We&#8217;re human, like the
rest of the world. We&#8217;re selfish like everybody
else. But we&#8217;re kind. And most of us still believe
in God. I&#8217;ve gone through a lot,&#8221; he was flushed
with the sense of the intimacy of his confession;
&#8220;you boys can&#8217;t ever know what I&#8217;ve gone through
unless you go through it some day yourselves. But
every night I thank God on my knees that I was a
part of a crusade that believed it was fighting for
the right. Those of us who went in with that idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
came out of it with that idea. That&#8217;s all I can say
about it&mdash;and I&#8217;d do it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he stood there on the hearth-rug, the boys
gazed at him with awe in their eyes. They knew
patriotic passion when they saw it, and here in this
broken man was a dignity which seemed to make
him a tower above them. They felt for the moment
as if his head touched the stars.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t misunderstand me,&#8221; Evans continued;
&#8220;war is hell. And most of us found horrors worse
than any dreadful dream. But we learned one
thing, that death isn&#8217;t awful. It is kind and beneficent.
And there&#8217;s something beyond.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee,&#8221; said Sandy Stoddard, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you said
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Arthur Lane did not speak. He saw Evans
through a haze of hero-worship. He saw him, too,
with a halo of martyrdom. The glass of the photograph
on the mantel had been mended. There was
the young soldier handsome and brave in his uniform.
And here was his ghost&mdash;come back to say
that it was all&mdash;worth while....</p>

<p>Association with these boys cleared up many
things for Evans. They had ideals which must not
be shattered. Not to their young eagerness must
be brought the pessimism of a disordered mind&mdash;and
tortured soul. They must have the truth.
And the truth was this. That men who had laid
down their lives to save others had seen an unforgetful
vision. He wondered how many of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
comrades, even now, in the cynicism of after-war
propaganda would sacrifice the memory of that high
moment....</p>

<p>Besides the boys, Evans had another friend. He
played a whimsical game with the scarecrow. He
went often and leaned over the fence that shut in
the frozen field. He hunted up new clothes and
hung them on the shaking figure&mdash;an overcoat and
a soft hat. It seemed a charitable thing to clothe
him with warmth. In due time someone stole the
overcoat, and Evans found the poor thing stripped.
It gave him a sense of shock to find two crossed
sticks where once had been the semblance of a man.
But he tried again. This time with an old bathrobe
and a disreputable cap. &#8220;It will keep you
warm until spring, old chap....&#8221;</p>

<p>The scarecrow and his sartorial changes became
a matter of much discussion among the negroes.
Since Evans&#8217; visits were nocturnal, the whole thing
had an effect of mystery until the bathrobe proclaimed
its owner. &#8220;Mist&#8217; Evans done woh&#8217; dat
e&#8217;vy day,&#8221; old Mary told Mrs. Follette. &#8220;Whuffor
he dress up dat ol&#8217; sca&#8217;crow in de fiel&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What scarecrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Mary explained, and that night Mrs. Follette
said to her son, &#8220;The darkies are getting superstitions.
Did you really do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>His somber eyes were lighted for a moment.
&#8220;It&#8217;s just a whim of mine, Mumsie. I had a sort
of fellow feeling&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>&#8220;How queer!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not as queer as you might think.&#8221; He went
back to his book. No one but Jane should know
the truth.</p>

<p>And so he played the game. Working in his
office, dancing with Edith and Baldy, chumming
with the boys, dressing up the scarecrow. It seemed
sometimes a desperate game&mdash;there were hours in
which he wrestled with doubts. Could he ever get
back? Could he? There were times when it
seemed he could not. There were nights when
he did not sleep. Hours that he spent on his
knees....</p>

<p>So the December days sped, and it was just a
week before Christmas that Evans read the following
in his little book. &#8220;Dined with the Prestons.
Told father&#8217;s ham story.&mdash;Great hit. Potomac
frozen over. Skated in the moonlight with
Florence Preston.&mdash;Great stunt&mdash;home to hot
chocolate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more the Potomac was frozen over. Florence
Preston was married. But he mustn&#8217;t let the
thing pass. The young boy Evans would have
tingled with the thought of that frozen river.</p>

<p>It was after dinner, and Evans was in his room.
He hunted up Baldy. &#8220;Look here, old chap, there&#8217;s
skating on the river. Can&#8217;t we take Sandy and
Arthur with us and have an hour or two of it?
Your car will do the trick.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baldy laid down his book. &#8220;I have no philanthropies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
on a night like this. Moonlight. I&#8217;ll take
you and the boys and then I&#8217;ll go and get Edith
Towne.&#8221; He was on his feet. &#8220;I&#8217;ll call her up
now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The small boys were rapturous and riotous over
the plan. When they reached the ice, and Evans&#8217;
lame leg threatened to be a hindrance, the youngsters
took him between them, and away they sailed
in the miraculous world&mdash;three musketeers of good
fellowship and fun.</p>

<p>Baldy having brought Edith, put on her skates,
and they flew away like birds. She was all in
warm white wool&mdash;with white furs, and Baldy wore
a white sweater and cap. The silver of the night
seemed to clothe them in shining armor.</p>

<p>Baldy said things to her that made her pulses
beat. She found herself a little frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re such a darling poet. But life isn&#8217;t in
the least what you think it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do I think it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, all mountains and peaks and moonlight
nights.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it can be&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear child, it can&#8217;t. I have no illusions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think you haven&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was late when at last they took off their skates
and Edith invited them all to go home with her.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have something hot. I&#8217;m as hungry as a
dozen bears.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys giggled. &#8220;So am I,&#8221; said Sandy Stoddard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
But Arthur said nothing. His eyes were
occupied to the exclusion of his tongue. Edith
looked to him like some angel straight from heaven.
He had never seen anyone so particularly lovely.</p>

<p>So, packed in Baldy&#8217;s Ford, they made the
journey. The two small boys had an Arabian
Nights&#8217; feeling as they were led through the great
hall with its balconies, thence to the huge kitchen.</p>

<p>The servants had gone to bed, all except Waldron&mdash;who
led the way, and offered his services.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we&#8217;ll do it ourselves, Waldron,&#8221; Miss Towne
told him. &#8220;Is Uncle Fred in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Miss Towne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if he comes, tell him where we are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good, Miss Towne,&#8221; and Waldron backed
out impressively, the round eyes of the little boys
upon him.</p>

<p>Edith gave them the freedom of the amazing refrigerator,
which was white as milk and as big as a
house, and they brought forth with some hesitation
viands which seemed as unreal as the rest of it&mdash;cold
roast chickens with white frills on their legs,
a plate of salad with patterns on top of it in red
peppers and little green buttons which Evans said
were capers&mdash;the remains of a glorified sort of
Charlotte Russe&mdash;a castellated affair with candied
fruits.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do they eat things like this every day?&#8221; Sandy
asked Evans, with something like awe, &#8220;or am I
dreamin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>Evans nodded. &#8220;Some feast, isn&#8217;t it, old chap?&#8221;
He was warmed by the radiance of the freckled
boyish face.</p>

<p>Arthur Lane, always less talkative, had little to
say. He was steeping himself in atmosphere. He
had never been in a house like this. The kitchen
with its panelled ceiling, its white enamel, its
gleaming nickel, its firm, white painted furniture&mdash;its
white and brown tiling. It was all as utterly
fascinating as the things he read about in the fairy
books.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now the kitchen,&#8221; he said at last to Towne,
&#8220;what&#8217;s it so big for? Ain&#8217;t there only three of
them in the family?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there are six of us at home, and you could
put four of our kitchens into this. And that refrigerator&mdash;it&#8217;s
so big you could live in it. You
know, Mr. Follette, it&#8217;s bigger than our scout
tents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is,&#8221; Evans smiled at him. &#8220;Well, when
people have so much money, they think they need
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like it.&#8221; The boy was eager. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee&mdash;well, I am&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and young Arthur went
over to thrash it out with Sandy.</p>

<p>Evans, left to himself, wondered. Did he want
money? A great fortune? With Jane? The huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
silent house with all its servants? Jane, herself,
trailing up the stairs in all the dazzling draperies
imposed upon her by fashionable modistes? Jane,
miles away from him at the end of that massive
table in the great dining-room?</p>

<p>Were these his dreams? For Jane?</p>

<p>He knew they were not. When he thought of
her, he thought of a little house. Of a living-room
where a fire burned bright whose windows looked
upon a little garden&mdash;crocuses and hyacinths in the
spring, roses in June, snow in winter, with all the
birds coming up for Jane to feed them. A library
with books to the ceiling, and himself reading to
Jane. A kitchen, a shining place, with a crisp
maid to save Jane from drudgery. Two crisp
maids, perhaps, some day, if there were kiddies.</p>

<p>He asked no more than that. Why, it was all
the world for a man....</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>THE COSTUME BALL</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">So</span> Christmas Eve came, and the costume ball at
the Townes&#8217;. There were, as Baldy had told Jane,
just six of them at dinner. Cousin Annabel was
still in bed, and it was Adelaide Laramore who
made the sixth. Edith had told Mrs. Follette
frankly that she wished Adelaide had not been
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;But she fished for it. She always does. She
flatters Uncle Fred and he falls for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baldy brought Evans and Mrs. Follette in his
little Ford. They found Mrs. Laramore and Frederick
already in the drawing-room. Edith had not
come down.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is always late,&#8221; Frederick complained,
&#8220;and she never apologizes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baldy, silken and slim, in his page&#8217;s scarlet, stood
in the hall and watched Edith descend the stairs.
She seemed to emerge from the shadows of the
upper balcony like a shaft of light. She was all in
silvery green, her close-clinging robe girdled with
pearls, her hair banded with mistletoe.</p>

<p>He met her half-way. &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t have worn
it,&#8221; he said at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;The mistletoe? Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>&#8220;You will tempt all men to kiss you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Men must resist temptation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, queens command,&#8221; he smiled at her,
&#8220;and queens ask&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She was doubtful of his meaning. &#8220;Do you
think that I would ever ask for kisses?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may. Some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her blue eyes burned. &#8220;I think you don&#8217;t quite
know what you are saying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, dear lady. But we won&#8217;t quarrel about
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She switched to less dangerous topics. &#8220;I&#8217;m late
for dinner. Is Uncle Fred roaring?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More or less. And Mrs. Laramore is purring.&#8221;</p>

<p>They rather wickedly enjoyed their laugh at the
expense of an older generation, and went in together
to find Frederick icy with indignation.</p>

<p>Waldron announced dinner, and Frederick with
Mrs. Follette on his arm preceded the others.
Baldy and Edith came last.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many dances are you going to give me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not as many as I&#8217;d like. Being hostess, I shall
have to divide myself among many.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut yourself up into little stars as it were.
Well, you know what Browning says of a star?
&#8216;Mine has opened its soul to me&mdash;therefore I love
it&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>His tone was light, but her heart missed a beat.
There was something about this boy so utterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
engaging. He had set her on a pedestal, and he
worshipped her. When she said that she was not
worth worshipping, he told her, &#8220;You don&#8217;t
know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She was unusually silent during dinner. With
Evans on one side of her and Baldy on the other
she had little need to exert herself. Baldy was
always adequate to any conversational tax, and
Evans, in spite of his monk&#8217;s habit, was not austere.
He was, rather, like some attractive young friar
drawn back for the moment to the world.</p>

<p>He showed himself a genial teller of tales&mdash;and
capped each of Frederick&#8217;s with one of his own.
His mother was proud of him. She felt that life
was taking on new aspects&mdash;this friendship with the
Townes&mdash;her son&#8217;s increasing strength and social
ease&mdash;the lace gown which she wore and which had
been bought with a Dickens&#8217; pamphlet. What more
could she ask? She was serene and satisfied.</p>

<p>Adelaide, on the other side of Frederick Towne,
was not serene and satisfied. She was looking
particularly lovely with a star of diamonds in her
hair and sheer draperies of rose and faintest green.
&#8220;I am anything you wish to call me,&#8221; she had said
to Frederick when she came in&mdash;&#8220;an &#8216;Evening
Star&#8217; or &#8216;In the Gloaming&#8217; or &#8216;Afterglow.&#8217; Perhaps
&#8216;A Rose of Yesterday&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she had put it
rather pensively.</p>

<p>He had been gallant but uninspired. &#8220;You are
too young to talk of yesterdays,&#8221; he had said, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
his glance had held not the slightest hint of gallantry.
She felt that she had, perhaps, been unwise
to remind him of her age.</p>

<p>She was still more disturbed, when, towards the
end of dinner, he rose and proposed a toast. &#8220;To
little Jane Barnes, A Merry Christmas.&#8221;</p>

<p>They all stood up. There was a second&#8217;s silence.
Evans drank as if he partook of a sacrament.</p>

<p>Then Edith said, &#8220;It seems almost heartless to
be happy, doesn&#8217;t it, when things are so hard for
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>Adelaide interposed irrelevantly, &#8220;I should hate
to spend Christmas in Chicago.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no response, so she turned to Frederick.
&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t Miss Barnes leave her sister for
a few days?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he told her, &#8220;she couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>She persisted, &#8220;I am sure you didn&#8217;t want her to
miss the ball.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did my best to get her here. Talked to her
at long distance, but she couldn&#8217;t see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are so good-hearted, Ricky.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frederick could be cruel at moments, and her
persistence was irritating. &#8220;Oh, look here, Adelaide,
it wasn&#8217;t entirely on her account. I want her
here myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat motionless, her eyes on her plate. When
she spoke again it was of other things. &#8220;Did you
hear that Delafield is coming back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who told you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>&#8220;Eloise Harper. Benny&#8217;s sister saw Del at
Miami. She is sure he is expecting to marry the
other girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad taste, I call it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody is crazy to know who she is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have they any idea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Benny&#8217;s sister said he talked quite
frankly about getting married. But he wouldn&#8217;t
say a word about the woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly think he will find Edith heart-broken.&#8221;
Towne glanced across the table. Edith was not
wearing the willow. No shadow marred her lovely
countenance. Her eyes were clear and shining
pools of sweet content.</p>

<p>Her uncle was proud of that high-held head. He
and Edith might not always hit it off. But, by
Jove, he was proud of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, she&#8217;s not heart-broken,&#8221; Adelaide&#8217;s cool
tone disturbed his reflections, &#8220;she is getting her
heart mended.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are an attractive pair, little Jane and
her brother. And the boy has lost his head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Over Edith? Oh, well, she plays around with
him; there&#8217;s nothing serious in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too sure. She&#8217;s interested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you insist on that?&#8221; irritably.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know the signs, dear man,&#8221; the cat seemed to
purr, but she had claws.</p>

<p>And it was Adelaide who was right. Edith had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
come to the knowledge that night of what Baldy
meant to her.</p>

<p>As she had entered the ballroom men had
crowded around her. &#8220;Why,&#8221; they demanded, &#8220;do
you wear mistletoe, if you don&#8217;t want to pay the
forfeit?&#8221;</p>

<p>Backed up against one of the marble pillars, she
held them off. &#8220;I do want to pay it, but not to any
of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her frankness diverted them. &#8220;Who is the
lucky man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is here. But he doesn&#8217;t know he is lucky.&#8221;</p>

<p>They thought she was joking. But she was not.
And on the other side of the marble pillar a page in
scarlet listened, with joy and fear in his heart.
&#8220;How fast we are going. How fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was dancing until midnight, then the curtains
at the end of the room were drawn back, and
the tree was revealed. It towered to the ceiling, a
glittering, gorgeous thing. It was weighted with
gifts for everybody, fantastic toys most of them, expensive,
meaningless.</p>

<p>Evans, standing back of the crowd, was aware of
the emptiness of it all. Oh, what had there been
throughout the evening to make men think of the
Babe who had been born at Bethlehem?</p>

<p>The gifts of the Wise Men? Perhaps. Gold
and frankincense and myrrh? One must not judge
too narrowly. It was hard to keep simplicities in
these opulent days.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>Yet he was heavy-hearted, and when Eloise Harper
charged up to him, dressed somewhat scantily
as a dryad, and handed him a foolish monkey
on a stick, she seemed to suggest a heathen saturnalia
rather than anything Christian and civilized.</p>

<p>&#8220;A monkey for a monk,&#8221; said Eloise. &#8220;Mr. Follette,
your cassock is frightfully becoming. But
you know you are a whited sepulchre.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. I&#8217;ll bet you never say your prayers.&#8221;</p>

<p>She danced away, unconscious that her words
had pierced him. What reason had she to think
that any of this meant more to him than it did
to her? Had he borne witness to the faith that was
within him? And was it within him? And if not,
why?</p>

<p>He stood there with his foolish monkey on his
stick, while around him swirled a laughing, shrieking
crowd. Why, the thing was a carnival, not a
sacred celebration. Was there no way in which he
might bear witness?</p>

<p>Edith had asked him to sing the old ballads,
&#8220;Dame, get up and bake your pies,&#8221; and &#8220;I saw
three ships a-sailing.&#8221; Evans was in no mood for
the dame who baked her pies on Christmas day in
the morning, or the pretty girls who whistled and
sang&mdash;on Christmas day in the morning.</p>

<p>When all the gifts had been distributed the lights
in the room were turned out. The only illumination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
was the golden effulgence which encircled the
tree.</p>

<p>In his monk&#8217;s robe, within that circle of light,
Evans seemed a mystical figure. He seemed, too,
appropriately ascetic, with his gray hair, the weary
lines of his old-young face.</p>

<p>But his voice was fresh and clear. And the song
he sang hushed the great room into silence.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;O little town of Bethlehem,</div>
<div class="verse">How still we see thee lie,</div>
<div class="verse">Above thy deep and dreamless sleep,</div>
<div class="verse">The silent stars go by;</div>
<div class="verse">Yet in thy dark streets shineth,</div>
<div class="verse">The everlasting light,</div>
<div class="verse">The hopes and fears of all the years</div>
<div class="verse">Are met in thee to-night.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>He sang as if he were alone in some vast arched
space, beneath spires that reached towards Heaven,
behind some grille that separated him from the
world.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;For Christ is born of Mary,</div>
<div class="verse">And gathered all above,</div>
<div class="verse">While mortals sleep, the angels keep</div>
<div class="verse">Their watch of wondering love.</div>
<div class="verse">O, morning stars together</div>
<div class="verse">Proclaim the holy birth!</div>
<div class="verse">And praises sing to God the King</div>
<div class="verse">And peace to men on earth.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And now it seemed to him that he sang not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
that crowd of upturned faces, not to those men and
women in shining silks and satins, not to Jane who
was far away, but to those others who pressed close&mdash;his
comrades across the Great Divide!</p>

<p>So he had sung to them in the hospital, sitting up
in his narrow bed&mdash;and most of the men who had
listened were&mdash;gone.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;O, holy child of Bethlehem,</div>
<div class="verse">Descend to us, we pray,</div>
<div class="verse">Cast out our sin and enter in,</div>
<div class="verse">Be born in us to-day.</div>
<div class="verse">We hear the Christmas angels</div>
<div class="verse">The great glad tidings tell:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8216;Oh come to us, abide with us,</div>
<div class="verse">Our Lord Emmanuel.&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>As the last words rang out his audience seemed
to wake with a sigh.</p>

<p>Then the lights went up. But the monk had
vanished!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Evans left word with Baldy that he would go
home on the trolley. &#8220;I am not quite up to the
supper and all that. Will you look after Mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. Say, Evans, that song was top
notch. Edith wants you to sing another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you tell her I can&#8217;t? I&#8217;m sorry. But the
last time I sang that was for the fellows&mdash;in
France. And it&mdash;got me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It got me, too,&#8221; Baldy confided; &#8220;made all this
seem&mdash;silly.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>So Evans left behind him all the youth and
laughter and light-heartedness, and took the last
trolley out to Castle Manor. He had a long walk
after the ride, but the cold air was stimulating, the
sky was full of stars and the night was very still.
Oh, how good it was to be out in that still and star-lighted
night!</p>

<p>When he reached Castle Manor he passed the
barn on his way to the house. He opened the door
and looked in. There was a lantern, faintly lit,
and he could see the cows resting on their beds of
straw&mdash;great dim creatures, smelling of milk and
hay&mdash;calm-eyed, inscrutable.</p>

<p>He entered and sat down. He felt soothed and
comforted by the tranquillity of the dumb beasts&mdash;the
eloquent silence.</p>

<p>He was glad he had escaped from the clamor of
the costume ball&mdash;from Eloise and her kind.</p>

<p>Yet the Man born at Bethlehem had not escaped.
He had gone among the multitudes&mdash;speaking.</p>

<p>Well ... it couldn&#8217;t be expected, could it,
that men in these days would say to a girl like
Eloise Harper, &#8220;For unto you is born this day in
the city of David, a Saviour which is Christ the
Lord&#8221;?</p>

<p>People didn&#8217;t say such things in polite society
... and if they didn&#8217;t, why not? And if they
did, would the world listen?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>NEWS FOR THE TOWN-CRIER</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was just before New Year&#8217;s that Lucy Logan
brought a letter for Frederick Towne to sign, and
when he had finished she said, &#8220;Mr. Towne, I&#8217;m
sorry, but I&#8217;m not going to work any more. So
will you please accept my resignation?&#8221;</p>

<p>He showed his surprise. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?
Aren&#8217;t we good enough for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that.&#8221; She stopped and went on, &#8220;I&#8217;m
going to be married, Mr. Towne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Married?&#8221; He was at once congratulatory.
&#8220;That&#8217;s a pleasant thing for you, and I mustn&#8217;t
spoil it by telling you how hard it is going to be to
find someone to take your place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think if you will have Miss Dale? She&#8217;s
really very good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frederick was curious. What kind of lover had
won this quiet Lucy? Probably some clerk or
salesman. &#8220;What about the man? Nice fellow, I
hope&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very nice, Mr. Towne,&#8221; she flushed, and her
manner seemed to forbid further questioning. She
went away, and he gave orders to the cashier to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
that she had an increase in the amount of her
final check. &#8220;She will need some pretty things.
And when we learn the date we can give her a
present.&#8221;</p>

<p>So on Saturday night Lucy left, and on the following
Monday a card was brought up to Edith
Towne.</p>

<p>She read it. &#8220;Lucy Logan? I don&#8217;t believe I
know her,&#8221; she said to the maid.</p>

<p>&#8220;She says she is from Mr. Towne&#8217;s office, and
that it is important.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Josephine, the parlor maid, had a nice sense
of the proprieties which she had learned from Waldron,
who was not on duty in the front of the house
in the morning. So she had given Lucy a chair in
the great hall. Waldron had emphasized that business
callers and social inferiors must never be ushered
into the drawing-room. The grade below
Lucy&#8217;s was, indeed, sent around to a side door.</p>

<p>However, there Lucy sat&mdash;in a dark blue cape
and a small blue hat, and she rose as Edith came up
to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s go where we can be comfortable,&#8221;
Edith said, and led the way through the gray and
white drawing-room beyond the peacock screen, to
the glowing warmth of the fire.</p>

<p>They were a great contrast, these two women.
Edith in a tea-gown of pale yellow was the last
word in modishness. Lucy, in her modest blue,
had no claims to distinction.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>But Lucy was not ill at ease. &#8220;Miss Towne,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;I have resigned from your uncle&#8217;s office.
Did he tell you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Uncle Fred rarely speaks about business.&#8221;</p>

<p>With characteristic straightforwardness Lucy
came at once to the point. &#8220;I have something I
must talk over with you. I don&#8217;t know whether I
am doing the wise thing. But it is the only honest
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine what you can have to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No you can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s this&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she hesitated,
then spoke with an effort. &#8220;I am the girl Mr.
Simms is in love with. He wants to come back and
marry me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edith&#8217;s fingers caught at the arm of the chair.
&#8220;Do you mean that it was because of you&mdash;that
he didn&#8217;t marry me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He used to come to the office when he
was in Washington and dictate letters. And we
got in the way of talking to each other. He seemed
to enjoy it, and he wasn&#8217;t like some men&mdash;who are
just&mdash;silly. And I began to think about him a lot.
But I didn&#8217;t let him see it. And&mdash;he told me afterward,
he was always thinking of me. And the
morning of your wedding day he came down to the
office&mdash;to say &#8216;Good-bye.&#8217; He said he&mdash;just had to.
And&mdash;well, he let it out that he loved me, and didn&#8217;t
want to marry you. But he said he would have to
go on with it. And&mdash;and I told him he must not,
Miss Towne.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>Edith stared at her. &#8220;Do you mean that what
he did was your fault?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s face was white, &#8220;if you want to
put it that way. I told him he hadn&#8217;t any right to
marry you if he loved me.&#8221; She hesitated, then
lifted her eyes to Edith&#8217;s with a glance of appeal.
&#8220;Miss Towne, I wonder if you are big enough to
believe that it was just because I cared so much&mdash;and
not because of his money?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a challenge. Edith had been ready to
pour out her wrath on the head of this girl to whom
she owed the humiliation of the past weeks, but
there was about Lucy a certain sturdiness, a courage
which was arresting.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think you love him?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I do. And you don&#8217;t. You never have.
And he didn&#8217;t love you. Why&mdash;if he should lose
every cent to-morrow, and I had to tramp the road
with him, I&#8217;d do it gladly. And you wouldn&#8217;t.
You wouldn&#8217;t want him unless he could give you
everything you have now, would you? Would you,
Miss Towne?&#8221;</p>

<p>Edith&#8217;s sense of justice dictated her answer.
&#8220;No,&#8221; she found herself unexpectedly admitting.
&#8220;If I had to tramp the roads with him, I&#8217;d be bored
to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he knew that, Miss Towne. He told me
that if he didn&#8217;t marry you, your heart wouldn&#8217;t be
broken. That it would just hurt your pride.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edith had a moment of hysterical mirth. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
they had talked her over. Her lover&mdash;and her
uncle&#8217;s stenographer! What a tragedy it had been!
And what a comedy!</p>

<p>She leaned forward a little, locking her fingers
about her knees. &#8220;I wish you&#8217;d tell me all about
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know just what to tell. Except that
we&#8217;ve been writing to each other. I said that we
must wait three months. It didn&#8217;t seem fair to you
to have him marry too soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle Fred&#8217;s stenographer sorry for her! &#8220;Go
on,&#8221; Edith said, tensely.</p>

<p>So Lucy told the simple story. And in telling it
showed herself so naive, so steadfast, that Edith
was aware of an increasing respect for the woman
who had taken her place in the heart of her lover.
She perceived that Lucy had come to this interview
in no spirit of triumph. She had dreaded it, but
had felt it her duty. &#8220;I thought it would be
easier for you if you knew it before other people
did.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edith&#8217;s forehead was knitted in a slight frown.
&#8220;The whole thing has been most unpleasant,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;When are you going to marry him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told him on St. Valentine&#8217;s day. It seemed&mdash;romantic.&#8221;</p>

<p>Romance and Del! Edith had a sudden illumination.
Why, this was what he had wanted, and
she had given him none of it! She had laughed at
him&mdash;been his good comrade. Little Lucy adored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
him&mdash;and had set St. Valentine&#8217;s day for the wedding!</p>

<p>There was nothing small about Edith Towne.
She knew fineness when she saw it, and she had a
feeling of humility in the presence of little Lucy.
&#8220;I think it was my fault as much as Del&#8217;s,&#8221; she
stated. &#8220;I should never have said &#8216;Yes.&#8217; People
haven&#8217;t any right to marry who feel as we did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; Lucy said rapturously, &#8220;how dear of you
to say that. Miss Towne, I always knew you were&mdash;big.
But I didn&#8217;t dream you were so beautiful.&#8221;
Tears wet her cheeks. &#8220;You&#8217;re just&mdash;marvellous,&#8221;
she said, wiping them away.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not.&#8221; Edith&#8217;s eyes were on the fire.
&#8220;Normally, I am rather proud and&mdash;hateful. If
you had come a week ago&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Her voice fell
away into silence as she still stared at the fire.</p>

<p>Lucy looked at her curiously. &#8220;A week ago?&#8221;</p>

<p>Edith nodded. &#8220;Do you like fairy tales? Well,
once there was a princess. And a page came and
sang&mdash;under her window.&#8221; The fire purred and
crackled. &#8220;And the princess&mdash;liked the song&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Lucy, under her breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; said Edith; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know the
end.&#8221; She stretched herself lazily. Her loose
sleeves, floating away from her bare arms, gave the
effect of wings. Lucy, looking at her, wondered
how it had ever happened that Delafield could have
turned his eyes from that rare beauty to her own
undistinguished prettiness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>She stood up. &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you how thankful I
am that I came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to run away yet,&#8221; Edith told
her. &#8220;I want you to have lunch with me. Upstairs.
You must tell me all your plans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t many. And I really oughtn&#8217;t to
stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? I want you. Please don&#8217;t say no.&#8221;</p>

<p>So up they went, with the perturbed parlor maid
speaking through the tube to the pantry. &#8220;Miss
Towne wants luncheon for two, Mr. Waldron. In
her room. Something nice, she says, and plenty
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Lucy had never seen such a room as the
one to which Edith led her. The whole house was,
indeed, a dream palace. Yet it was the atmosphere
with which her lover would soon surround her.
She had a feeling almost of panic. What would
she do with a maid like Alice, who was helping
Josephine set up the folding-table, spread the
snowy cloth, bring in the hot silver dishes?</p>

<p>As if Edith divined her thought, she said when
the maids had left, &#8220;Lucy, will you let me advise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, Miss Towne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to be&mdash;like the rest of us. Like Del&#8217;s
own crowd, I mean. He fell in love with you because
you were different. He will want you to
stay&mdash;different.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I shall have so much to learn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edith was impatient. &#8220;What must you learn?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Externals? Let them alone. Be yourself. You
have dignity&mdash;and strength. It was the strength in
you that won Del. You and he can have a life together
that will mean a great deal, if you will make
him go your way. But you must not go his&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucy considered that. &#8220;You mean that the
crowd he is with weakens him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean just that. They&#8217;re sophisticated beyond
words. You&#8217;re what they would call&mdash;provincial.
Oh, be provincial, Lucy. Don&#8217;t be afraid. But
don&#8217;t adopt their ways. You go to church, don&#8217;t
you? Say your prayers? Believe that God&#8217;s in
His world?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucy&#8217;s fair cheeks were flushed. &#8220;Why, of
course I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we don&#8217;t&mdash;not many of us,&#8221; said Edith.
&#8220;The thing you have got to do is to interest Del in
something. Don&#8217;t just go sailing away with him
in his yacht. Buy a farm over in Virginia, and
help him make a success of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he lives in New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he does. But he can live anywhere.
He&#8217;s so rich that he doesn&#8217;t have to earn anything,
and his office is just a fiction. You must make him
work. Go in for a fad; blooded horses, cows, black
Berkshires. Do you know what a black Berkshire
is, Lucy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a kind of a pig. And that&#8217;s the thing
for you and Del. He really loves fine stock. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
you and he&mdash;think of it&mdash;riding over the country&mdash;planning
your gardens&mdash;having a baby or two.&#8221;
Edith was going very fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;It sounds heavenly,&#8221; said Lucy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then make it Heaven. Oh, Lucy, Lucy, you
lucky girl&mdash;you are going to marry the man you
love. Live away from the world&mdash;share happiness
and unhappiness&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She rose from the table
restlessly, pushing back her chair, dropping her
napkin on the floor. &#8220;Do you know how I envy
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She went to the window and stood looking out.
&#8220;And here I sit, day after day, like a prisoner in a
tower&mdash;and my page sings&mdash;that was the beginning
of it&mdash;and it will be the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Lucy was very serious, &#8220;you mustn&#8217;t let it
be the end. You&mdash;you must open the window, Miss
Towne.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edith came back to the table. &#8220;Open the window?&#8221;
Her breath came fast. &#8220;Open the window.
Oh, little Lucy, how wise you are....&#8221;</p>

<p>When Lucy had gone, Alice came in and dressed
Edith&#8217;s hair. She found her lady thoughtful.
&#8220;Alice, what did they do with my wedding
clothes?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the first time she had mentioned them.
Alice, sticking in hairpins, was filled with eager
curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;We put them all in the second guest-suite,&#8221; she
said; &#8220;some of them we left packed in the trunks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
just as they were, and some of them are hung on
racks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the wedding dress?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a closet in a white linen bag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, finish my hair and we will go and look
at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice stuck in the last pin. &#8220;The veil is over a
satin roller. I did it myself, and put the cap part
in a bonnet-box.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they entered it, the second guest-suite was
heavy with the scent of orange blooms. &#8220;How
dreadful, Alice,&#8221; Edith ejaculated. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t
you throw the flowers away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Annabel wouldn&#8217;t let me. She said you
might not want things touched.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silly sentimentality.&#8221; Edith was impatient.</p>

<p>The room was in all the gloom of drawn curtains.
The dresses hung on racks, and, encased in white
bags, gave a ghostly effect. &#8220;They are like rows of
tombstones, Alice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Towne,&#8221; said Alice, dutifully.</p>

<p>The maid brought out the wedding dress and laid
it on the bed.</p>

<p>Edith, surveying it, was stung by the memory of
the emotions which had swayed her when she had
last worn it. It had seemed to mock her. She had
wanted to tear it into shreds. She had seen her
own tense countenance in the mirror, as she had
controlled herself before Alice. Then, when the
maid had left, she had thrown herself on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
bed, and had writhed in an agony of humiliation.</p>

<p>And now all her anger was gone. She didn&#8217;t hate
Del. She didn&#8217;t hate Lucy. She even thought of
Uncle Fred with charity. And the wedding gown
was, after all, a robe for a princess who married
a king. Not a robe for a princess who loved a
page. A tender smile softened her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alice,&#8221; she said, suddenly, &#8220;wasn&#8217;t there a little
heliotrope dinner frock among my trousseau
things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Towne. Informal.&#8221; Alice hunted
in the third row of tombstones until she found it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want long sleeves put in it. Will you tell
Hardinger, and have him send a hat to match?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Towne.&#8221;</p>

<p>The heliotrope frock had simple and lovely lines.
It floated in sheer beauty from the maid&#8217;s hands as
she held it up. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t a prettier one in the
whole lot, Miss Edith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like it,&#8221; the fragrance of heliotrope was
wafted from hidden sachets, &#8220;and as for the wedding
gown,&#8221; Edith eyed it thoughtfully, &#8220;pack it
in a box with the veil and the rest of the things. I
want Briggs to take it with the note to an address
that I will give him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, Miss Towne.&#8221; Alice was much interested
in the address. She studied it when, later,
she carried the box and the note down to Briggs.</p>

<p>Edith, having dispatched the box with a charming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
note to Lucy Logan, had a feeling of ecstatic
freedom. All the hurt and humiliation of the bridal
episode had departed. She didn&#8217;t care what
the world thought of her. Her desertion by Del
had been material for a day&#8217;s gossip&mdash;then other
things had filled the papers, had been headlined
and emphasized. And what difference did it all
make?</p>

<p>The things that mattered were those of which
she had talked to Lucy. An old house&mdash;mutual
interests, all the rest of it. &#8220;I would tramp the
road with him,&#8221; little Lucy had said. That was
love&mdash;to count nothing hard but the lack of it.</p>

<p>She was called to the telephone, and found Eloise
Harper at the other end. &#8220;Delafield is coming
back,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Benny has had a letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling town-crier,&#8221; said Edith, &#8220;you are late
with your news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by town-crier?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what we call you, dearest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do you?&#8221; dubiously. &#8220;Well, anyhow,
Delafield is on his way back, and he is going to be
married as soon as he gets here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he isn&#8217;t. Not until February.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The bride told me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; incredulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;The bride.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eloise gasped. &#8220;Edith, do you know who she
is?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>&#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, I can&#8217;t. The whole world would know
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I swear I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t swear, Eloise. You might perjure yourself,&#8221;
and Edith hung up the receiver.</p>

<small>AN INTERLUDE</small></h2></div>

<blockquote>

<p class="right"><i>The day after Christmas.</i></p>



<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Baldy,</span> darling: The operation is over, and
the doctor gives us hope. That is the best I can tell
you. I haven&#8217;t been allowed to see Judy, though
they have let Bob have a peep at her, and she
smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can imagine that we have had little heart
for good times. But the babies had a beautiful
Christmas Day, with a tree&mdash;and stockings hung
above the gas logs. How I longed for our own little
wood fire, but the blessed darlings didn&#8217;t know
the difference. We couldn&#8217;t spend much money,
which was fortunate. The things that came from
the east were so perfect. Yours, honey-boy, only
you shouldn&#8217;t have made the check so large. I
shan&#8217;t spend it unless it is very necessary. Mr.
Towne sent flowers, loads of them&mdash;and perfectly
marvellous chocolates in a box of gold lacquer&mdash;and
Edith sent a string of carved ivory beads, and
there was a blue Keats from Evans, and a ducky
orange scarf from Mrs. Follette.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you could have seen the babies. Julia
staggered around the tree on her uncertain little
feet as if she were drunk, and then settled down to
an adorable stuffed bunny, and Junior had eyes
for nothing but the red automobile that the Townes
ordered for him. I think it was dear of Edith and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
her uncle. Junior is such a charming chap, with
beautiful manners like his dad, but with a will of
his own at times.</p>

<p>&#8220;I roasted a chicken for dinner, and&mdash;well, we
got through it all. And now the babies are in bed,
and Bob is at the hospital, and I am writing to you.
But my heart is tight with fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mustn&#8217;t think about Judy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give my love to everybody. I have had Christmas
letters from Evans and Edith and Mr. Towne.
Baldy, Mr. Towne wants to marry me. I haven&#8217;t
told you before. It is rather like a dream and I&#8217;m
not going to think about it. I don&#8217;t love him, and
so, of course, that settles it. But he says he can
make me, and, Baldy, sometimes I wish that he
could. It would be such a heavenly thing for the
whole family. Of course that isn&#8217;t the way to look
at it, but I believe Judy wants it. She believes in
love in a cottage, but she says that love in a palace
might be equally satisfying, with fewer things to
worry about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somehow that doesn&#8217;t fit in with the things
I&#8217;ve dreamed. But dreams, of course, aren&#8217;t everything....</p>

<p>&#8220;I had to tell you, dear old boy. Because we&#8217;ve
never kept things from each other. And you&#8217;ve
been so perfectly frank about Edith. Are things
a bit blue in that direction? Your letter sounded
like it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be good to yourself, old dear, and love me more
than ever.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Jane signed her name and stood up, stretching
her arms above her head. It was late and she was
very tired. A great storm was shaking the windows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
The wind from the lake beat against the
walls with the boom of guns.</p>

<p>Jane pulled back the curtains&mdash;there was snow
with the storm&mdash;it whirled in papery shreds on the
shaft of light. All sounds in the street were muffled.
She had a sense of suffocation&mdash;as if the
storm pressed upon her&mdash;shutting her in.</p>

<p>She went into the next room and looked at the
babies. Oh, what would they do if anything happened
to Judy? What would Bob do? She dared
not look ahead.</p>

<p>She walked the floor, a tense little figure, fighting
against fear. The storm had become a whistling
pandemonium. She gave a cry of relief
when the door opened and her brother-in-law
entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m half-frozen, Janey. It was a fight to get
through. The cars are stopped on all the surface
lines.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is Judy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Holding her own. And by the way, Janey,
that friend of yours, Towne, sent another bunch of
roses. Pretty fine, I call it. She&#8217;s no end pleased.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nice of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, I wish I had his money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Money isn&#8217;t everything, Bobby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It means a lot at a time like this.&#8221; His face
wore a worried frown. Jane knew that Judy&#8217;s
hospital expenses were appalling, and bills were
piling up.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>&#8220;I work like a nigger,&#8221; Bob said, ruefully, &#8220;and
we&#8217;ve never been in debt before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When Judy is well, things will seem brighter,
Bob.&#8221; She laid her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>He looked up at her and there was fear in his
eyes. &#8220;Jane, she must get well. I can&#8217;t face losing
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We mustn&#8217;t think of that. And now come on
out in the kitchen and I&#8217;ll make you some coffee.&#8221;
Jane was always practical. She knew that,
warmed and fed, he would see things differently.</p>

<p>Yet in spite of her philosophy, Jane lay awake
a long time that night. And later her dreams were
of Judy&mdash;of Judy, and a gray and dreadful phantom
which pursued....</p>

<p>The next day she went to the hospital and took
Junior with her.</p>

<p>When he saw his mother in bed, Junior asked,
&#8220;Do you like it, Mother-dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like what, darling?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sleeping in the daytime?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t always sleep.&#8221; She looked at Jane.
&#8220;Does little Julia miss me? I think about her in
the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane knew what Judy&#8217;s heart wanted. &#8220;She does
miss you. I know it when she turns away from
me. Perhaps I oughtn&#8217;t to tell you. But I thought
you&#8217;d rather know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do want to know,&#8221; said Judy, feverishly. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
don&#8217;t want them to forget. Jane, you mustn&#8217;t ever
let them&mdash;forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane felt as if she had been struck a stunning
blow. She was, for a moment, in the midst of a
dizzy universe, in which only one thing was clear.
<i>Judy wasn&#8217;t sure of getting well!</i></p>

<p>Judy, with her brown eyes wistful, went on:
&#8220;Junior, do you want Mother back in your own
nice house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you make cookies?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, darling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I want you back. Aunt Janey made
cookies, and she didn&#8217;t know about the raisins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother knows how to give cookie-men raisin
eyes. Mothers know a lot of things that aunties
don&#8217;t, darling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I wish you&#8217;d come back.&#8221; He stood by the
side of the bed. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to sleep with you to-night.
May I, Mother-dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to-night, darling. But you may when I
come home.&#8221;</p>

<p>But days passed and weeks, and Judy did not
come home. And the first of February found her
still in that narrow hospital bed. And it was in
February that Frederick Towne wrote that he was
coming to Chicago. &#8220;I shall have only a day, but
I must see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane was not sure that she wanted him to
come. He had been very good to them all, and he
had not, in his letter, pressed for an answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
unduly. But she knew if he came, he would
ask.</p>

<p>The next time she went to the hospital, she told
Judy of his expected arrival. &#8220;To-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Jane, how delightful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it? I&#8217;m not sure, Judy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be perfect if you&#8217;d accept him, Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not in love with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Judy, rather austere, with her black braids on
each side of her white face, said, &#8220;Janey, do you
know that not one girl in a thousand has a chance
to marry a man like Frederick Towne?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a breathless excitement about the invalid
which warned Jane. &#8220;Now, darling, what
real difference will it make if I don&#8217;t marry him?
There are other men in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob and I were talking about it,&#8221; Judy&#8217;s voice
was almost painfully eager, &#8220;of how splendid it
would be for&mdash;all of us.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>For all of us.</i> Judy and Bob and the babies! It
was the first time that Jane had thought of her
marriage with Towne as a way out for Judy and
Bob....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From his hotel at the moment of arrival, Towne
called Jane up. &#8220;Are you glad I&#8217;m here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say it that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How shall I say it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As if you meant it. Do you know what a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
frigid little thing you are? Your letters were like
frosted cakes.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed. &#8220;They were the best I could do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it. But I am not going to talk
of that now. When can I come and see you? And
how much time have you to spare for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much. I can&#8217;t leave the babies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your sister&#8217;s children. Can&#8217;t you trust the
maids?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maids? Listen to the man! We haven&#8217;t any.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to tell me that you are doing
the housework.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, why not? I am strong and well, and the
kiddies are adorable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to change that. I&#8217;ll bring a
trained nurse up with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t be a tyrant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut-tut, little girl,&#8221; she heard his big laugh
over the telephone, &#8220;I&#8217;ll bring the nurse and someone
to help her, and a load of toys to keep the kiddies
quiet. When I want a thing, Jane, I usually
get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He and the nurse arrived together. A competent
houseworker was to follow in a cab. Jane
protested. &#8220;It seems dreadfully high-handed.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were alone in the living-room. Miss Martin
had, at once, carried the kiddies off to unpack
the toys.</p>

<p>Frederick laughed. &#8220;Well, what are you going
to do about it? You can&#8217;t put me out.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>&#8220;But I can refuse to go with you&#8221;&mdash;there was
the crisp note in her voice which always stirred him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you won&#8217;t do that, Jane.&#8221; He held out
his hand to her, drew her a little towards him.</p>

<p>She released herself, flushing. &#8220;I am not quite
sure what I ought to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why think of &#8216;oughts&#8217;? We will just play a
bit together, Jane. That&#8217;s all. And you&#8217;re such a
tired little girl, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>His sympathy was comforting. Everybody
leaned on Jane. It was delightful to shift her burdens
to this strong man who gave his commands
like a king.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am tired. And if the babies will be all
right&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. Now run in and see Miss Martin, and I
think you&#8217;ll be satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane found Junior rapturous over a Noah&#8217;s Ark,
with all the animals clothed in fur and hair, and
the birds in feathers, and small Julia cuddled
against the nurse&#8217;s white breast, bright-eyed with
interest over the Three Kittens.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be all right, Miss Barnes,&#8221; Miss Martin
said, smiling.</p>

<p>Jane sighed with relief. &#8220;It will seem good to
play for a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see how I get my way,&#8221; Frederick said, as
he helped her into the big hired limousine. &#8220;I always
get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is rather heavenly at the moment,&#8221; Jane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
admitted, &#8220;but you needn&#8217;t think that it establishes
a precedent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be always&mdash;heavenly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure. You have the makings of a&mdash;Turk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet she laughed as she said it, and he laughed,
too. He was really very handsome, ruddy and
bright and big&mdash;and with that air of gay deference.
She liked to sit beside him, and listen to the things
he had to tell her. It was peaceful after all the
strenuous days.</p>

<p>She was aware that if she married Towne life
would be always like this. A glorified existence.
She would be like Curlylocks of the nursery
rhyme....</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you smiling at?&#8221; Frederick demanded.
His eyes as they met hers burned a bit.
Jane was half-buried in a black fur robe&mdash;with
only the white oval of her face and her little gray
hat showing above it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nursery rhymes.&#8221; The smile deepened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Curlylocks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember it. Oh, yes, by Jove, I do.
She was the damsel who sat on a cushion and sewed
a fine seam, and feasted on strawberries, sugar and
cream?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. That&#8217;s what I want to do for you. You
know it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>&#8220;Yes. But it might be&mdash;monotonous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What better thing could happen to you than to
have someone take care of you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane sat up. &#8220;Oh, I want to <i>live</i>,&#8221; she said, almost
with fierceness. &#8220;I&#8217;d hate to think my husband
was just a sort of&mdash;feather cushion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that the way you think of me?&#8221; His vanity
was untouched. She didn&#8217;t, of course, mean it.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But love is life. I don&#8217;t want to miss
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t miss it if you marry me. I swear
it, Jane, I&#8217;ll make you love me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was in dead earnest. And in spite of herself
she was swayed by his attitude of conviction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we mustn&#8217;t talk of it,&#8221; she said, a bit
breathlessly. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather not, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>They lunched at a charming French restaurant,
where Frederick had dared Jane to eat snails. She
acquiesced rather unexpectedly. &#8220;I have always
wanted to do it,&#8221; she told him, &#8220;ever since I was a
little girl and read Hans Andersen&#8217;s story of the
white snails who lived in a forest of burdocks, and
whose claim to aristocracy was that their ancestors
had been baked and served in a silver dish.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had a table in a corner. He ordered the
luncheon expertly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you how much I am enjoying it,&#8221;
she said gratefully, as he once more gave her his
attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really like it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>&#8220;Immensely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not have it for the rest of your life?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her color deepened. &#8220;Sometimes I think it
would be&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavenly,&#8221; he finished the sentence for her.
&#8220;Jane, you only have to say the word.&#8221;</p>

<p>The waiter, with the first course, interrupted
them. When he once more disappeared, Frederick
persisted. &#8220;I&#8217;m going away to-morrow. Won&#8217;t
you give me my answer to-night? After lunch I&#8217;ll
take you home and you can rest a bit, and then I&#8217;ll
come for you and we&#8217;ll dine together and see a
play.&#8221;</p>

<p>She tried to protest, but he pleaded. &#8220;This is
my day. Don&#8217;t spoil it, Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was nearly three o&#8217;clock when they left the
table, and they had a long drive before them. Darkness
had descended when they reached the house.
It was still snowing.</p>

<p>Bob was up-stairs, walking around the little
room like a man in a dream.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you,&#8221; he confided to Jane after
Frederick had left, &#8220;how queer I felt when I came
in and found Miss Martin with the babies, and that
stately old woman in the kitchen. And everything
going like clockwork. Miss Martin explained, and&mdash;well,
Towne just waves a wand, doesn&#8217;t he,
Janey, and makes things happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I ought to let him do so
much,&#8221; Jane said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, why not, Janey? Just take the good the
gods provide....&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Frederick Towne reached his hotel he
passed a shop whose windows were lighted against
the early darkness. In one of the windows, flanked
by slippers and stockings and a fan to match, was
a French gown, all silver and faint blue, a shining
wisp of a thing in lace and satin. Towne stopped
the car, went in and bought the gown with its
matching accessories. He carried the big box with
him to his hotel. Resting a bit before dinner he
permitted himself to dream of Jane in that gown,
the pearls that he would give her against the white
of her slender throat, the slim bareness of her arms,
the swirl of a silver lace about her ankles&mdash;the
swing of the boyish figure in its sheath of blue.</p>

<p>He permitted himself to think of her, too, in
other gowns. His thoughts of her frocks were all
definite. He had exquisite taste. If he married
Jane, he would dress her so that people would look
at her, and look again. Even in her poverty, she
had learned to express herself in the things she
wore. His money would make possible even more
subtle expression.</p>

<p>So he thought of her in gray chiffon, black pearls
in her ears&mdash;oh, to think of Jane in earrings!&mdash;with
a touch of jade where the draperies swung loose&mdash;and
with an oyster-white lining to the green cape
which would cover the gown&mdash;a lynx collar up to
her ears.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>Or a tea-gown of tangerine lace&mdash;with bands of
sable catching the open sleeves at the wrist&mdash;or in
white&mdash;Jane&#8217;s wedding dress must be heavy with
pearls&mdash;she lent herself perfectly to medieval effects.</p>

<p>His mind came back to the blue and silver. It
hung on the bed-post, shimmering in the light from
his lamp. He wondered if he offered it to Jane,
would she accept? He knew she wouldn&#8217;t. Adelaide
would have made no bones about it. There
had been a lovely thing in black velvet he had given
her, too, a wrap to match.</p>

<p>But Jane was different. She would shrug her
shoulders and with that charming independence,
decline his favors, tilting her chin, and challenging
him with her lighted-up eyes.</p>

<p>Well, he liked her for it. Loved her for it. And
some day she would wear the blue and silver frock.
As he rose and put it back in the box, he seemed
to shut Jane in with it. There hung about it the
scent of roses. He knew of a rare perfume. He
would order a vial of it for Jane. It merely hinted
at fragrance.</p>

<p>The evening stretched ahead of him, full of radiant
promise. He knew Jane&#8217;s strength but he was
ready for conquest.</p>

<p>His telephone rang. And Jane spoke to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Towne,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t dine with you.
But can you come over later? Judy is desperately
ill. I&#8217;ll tell you more about it when I see you.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>SURRENDER</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Bob</span> had cried when the news came from the hospital.
It had been dreadful. Jane had never seen
a man cry. They had been hard sobs, with broken
apologies between. &#8220;I&#8217;m a fool to act like
this....&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane had tried to say things, then had sat silent
and uncomfortable while Bob fought for self-control.</p>

<p>Miss Martin had gone home before the message
arrived. Bob was told that he could not see his
wife. But the surgeon would be glad to talk to
him, at eight.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I know what he&#8217;ll say,&#8221; Bob had said to
Jane drearily, &#8220;that if I can get that specialist up
from Hot Springs, he may be able to diagnose the
trouble. But how am I going to get the money,
Janey? It will cost a thousand dollars to rush him
here and pay his fee. And my income has practically
stopped. With all these labor troubles&mdash;there&#8217;s
no building. And Judy&#8217;s nurses cost
twelve dollars a day&mdash;and her room five. Oh,
poor people haven&#8217;t any right to be sick, Janey.
There isn&#8217;t any place for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane&#8217;s face was pale and looked pinched.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
&#8220;There&#8217;s the check Baldy sent me for Christmas,
fifty dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear girl, it wouldn&#8217;t be a drop in the bucket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; thoughtfully. &#8220;Bob, do they think
that if that specialist comes it will save Judy&#8217;s
life?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might. It&mdash;it&#8217;s the last chance, Janey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janey hugged her knees. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you borrow the
money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have borrowed up to the limit of my securities,
and how can I ever pay?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice was grim. &#8220;We will manage to pay;
the thing now is to save Judy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he tried, pitifully, to meet her courage.
&#8220;If they&#8217;ll get the specialist, we&#8217;ll pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had risen. &#8220;I&#8217;ll call up Mr. Towne, and tell
him I can&#8217;t dine with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Janey, there&#8217;s no reason why you
shouldn&#8217;t keep your engagement.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had turned on him with a touch of indignation.
&#8220;Do you think I could have one happy moment
with my mind on Judy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob had looked at her, and then looked away.
&#8220;Have you thought that you might get the money
from Towne?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her startled gaze had questioned him. &#8220;Get
money from Mr. Towne?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Oh, why not, Janey? He&#8217;ll do anything
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how could I pay him?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>There had been dead silence, then Bob said,
&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s in love with you, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that I can&mdash;marry him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Why not? Judy says he&#8217;s crazy about
you. And, Jane, it&#8217;s foolish to throw away such a
chance. Not every girl has it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Bob, I&#8217;m not&mdash;in love with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll learn to care&mdash;&mdash; He&#8217;s a delightful
chap, I&#8217;d say.&#8221; Bob was eager. &#8220;Now look here,
Janey, I&#8217;m talking to you like a Dutch uncle. It
isn&#8217;t as if I were advising you to do it for our sakes.
It is for your own sake, too. Why, it would be
great, old girl. Never another worry. Somebody
always to look after you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wind outside was singing a wild song, a roaring,
cynical song, it seemed to Jane. She wanted to
say to Bob, &#8220;But I&#8217;ve always been happy in my
little house with Baldy and Philomel, and the
chickens and the cats.&#8221; But of course Bob could
say, &#8220;You&#8217;re not happy now, and anyhow what are
you going to do about Judy?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Judy!</i></p>

<p>She had spoken at last with an effort. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell
him to come over after dinner. We can ride for a
bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not stay here? I&#8217;ll be at the hospital.
And the storm is pretty bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had looked out of the window. &#8220;There&#8217;s no
snow. Just the wind. And I feel&mdash;stifled.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was then that she had called up Towne. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
can&#8217;t dine with you.... Judy is desperately
ill....&#8221;</p>

<p>The houseworker had prepared a delicious dinner,
but Jane ate nothing. Bob&#8217;s appetite, on the
other hand, was good. He apologized for it. &#8220;I
went without lunch, I was so worried.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane remembered her own lunch&mdash;how careless
she had been for the moment, forgetting her heaviness
of heart&mdash;served like a princess sheltered from
every wind that blew!</p>

<p>And all the rest of her life might be like that!
It wouldn&#8217;t be so bad. She drank a cup of coffee,
and then another. And Frederick had said that
he could make her love him....</p>

<p>In the center of the table were some roses that
Towne had given her. She stuck one of them in
her girdle.</p>

<p>Bob finished his coffee, and stood up. &#8220;I must
be going. Good luck to you, old girl....&#8221;
His tone was almost cheerful. He walked around
the table and touched his lips to her cheek.</p>

<p>When she was alone, she went in and looked at
the babies. Junior had taken some of the animals
to bed with him, and they trailed over the white
cover&mdash;tiny tigers and elephants, lions and giraffes.
Little Julia hugged her doll. How sweet she was,
and such a baby!</p>

<p>And in the hospital Judy&#8217;s arms ached to enfold
that warm little body: Judy&#8217;s heart beat with fear
lest they should never enfold her again!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>The bell rang. Jane, going to the door, found
herself shaking with excitement.</p>

<p>Frederick came in and took both of her hands in
his. &#8220;I&#8217;m terribly sorry about the sister. Is there
anything I can do?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head. She could hardly speak.
&#8220;I thought if you wouldn&#8217;t mind, we&#8217;d go for a
ride. And we can talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. Get your wraps.&#8221; He released her
hands, and she went into the other room. As she
looked into the mirror she saw that her cheeks were
crimson.</p>

<p>She brought out her coat and he held it for her.
&#8220;Is this warm enough? You ought to have a fur
coat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I shall be warm,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>As he preceded her down the stairs, Towne
turned and looked up at her. &#8220;You are wearing
my rose,&#8221; he told her, ardently; &#8220;you are like a
rose yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>She would not have been a woman if she had not
liked his admiration. And he was strong and
adoring and distinguished. She had a sense of
almost happy excitement as he lifted her into the
car.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where shall we drive?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Along the lake. I love it on a night like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>The moon was sailing high in a rack of clouds.
As they came to the lake the waves writhed like
mad sea-monsters in gold and white and black.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>&#8220;Jane,&#8221; Frederick asked softly, &#8220;what made you
wear&mdash;my rose?&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat very still beside him. &#8220;Mr. Towne,&#8221; she
said at last, &#8220;tell me how much&mdash;you love me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave a start of surprise. Then he turned
towards her and took her hand in his. &#8220;Let me
tell you this! there never was a dearer woman.
Everything that I have, all that I am, is yours if
you will have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a fine dignity in his avowal. She liked
him more than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you love me enough&#8221;&mdash;she hurried over the
words, &#8220;to help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; He drew her gently towards him. There
was no struggle. She lay quietly against his arm,
but he was aware that she trembled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Towne, Judy must have a great specialist
right away. It&#8217;s her only chance. If you will send
for him to-night, make yourself responsible for&mdash;everything&mdash;I&#8217;ll
marry you whenever you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stared down at her, unbelieving. &#8220;Do you
mean it, Jane?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Oh, do you think I am dreadful?&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed exultantly, caught her up to him.
&#8220;Dreadful? You&#8217;re the dearest&mdash;ever, Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet as he felt her fluttering heart, he released
her gently. Her eyes were full of tears. He
touched her wet cheek. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let me frighten
you, my dear. But I am very happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>She believed herself happy. He was really&mdash;irresistible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
A conqueror. Yet always with that
touch of deference.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you love me, Jane?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not&mdash;yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you will. I&#8217;ll make you love me.&#8221;</p>

<p>With keen intuition, with his knowledge, too, of
women, he asked for no further assurance. He
leaned back against the cushions of the car, and
holding her hand in his, made plans for their future.
He would get the ring to-morrow. He would
come again in a week. As soon as Judy was better,
he and Jane would be married.</p>

<p>Then just before they reached home he asked for
the rose. She gave it to him, all fading fragrance.
He touched it to her lips then crushed it against
his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must I be content with this?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her quick breath told her agitation. He drew
her to him, gently. &#8220;Come, my sweet.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Oh, money, money. Jane learned that night the
power of it!</p>

<p>Coming in with Frederick from that wild moonlighted
world, flushed with excitement, hardly
knowing this new Jane, she saw Bob transformed
in a moment from haggard hopelessness to wild
elation.</p>

<p>Frederick Towne had made a simple statement.
&#8220;Jane has told me how serious things are, Heming.
I want to help.&#8221; Then he had asked for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
surgeon&#8217;s name; spoken at once of a change of
rooms for Judy; increased attendance. There was
much telephoning and telegraphing. An atmosphere
of efficiency. Jane, looking on, was filled
with admiration. How well he did things. And
some day he would be her husband!</p>

<p>Towne was, indeed, at his best. Deeply in love
with her, all his generous impulses were quickened
for her service. When at last he had gone, she
went to bed, and lay awake almost until morning.
Doubts crowded upon her. Her cheeks burned as
she thought of the bargain she had made. He
would pay her sister&#8217;s bills&mdash;and she would marry
him. But it wasn&#8217;t just that! He was so tender,
so solicitous. Jane had not yet learned that one
may be in love with being loved, which is not in
the least the same as loving. Against the benefits
which Towne bestowed upon her, she could set only
her dreams of Galahad, of Robin Hood! Of romantic
adventure! Her memories&mdash;of Evans Follette.</p>

<p>She sighed as she thought of him. He would be
unhappy. Oh, darling old Evans! She cried a
little into her pillow. She mustn&#8217;t think of him.
The thing was done. She was going to marry Frederick
Towne!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>PAPER LACE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was two days after Jane promised to marry
Frederick Towne that Evans bought a Valentine
for her.</p>

<p>The shops were full of valentines&mdash;many of them
of paper lace&mdash;the fragile old-fashioned things that
had become a new fashion. They had forget-me-nots
on them and hearts with golden arrows, and
fat pink cupids.</p>

<p>Evans found it hard to choose. He stood before
them, smiling. And he could see Jane smile as she
read the enchanting verse of the one he finally selected:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Roses red, my dear,</div>
<div class="verse">And violets blue&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Honey&#8217;s sweet, my dear,</div>
<div class="verse">And so are you.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>As he walked up F Street to his office, his heart
was light. It was one of the lovely days that hint
of spring. Old Washingtonians know that such
weather does not last&mdash;that March winds must
blow, and storms must come. But they grasp the
joy of the moment&mdash;masquerade in carnival spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>&mdash;buy
flowers from the men at the street corners&mdash;sweep
into their favorite confectioner&#8217;s to order
cool drinks, the women seek their milliner&#8217;s and
come forth bonneted in spring beauty&mdash;the men
drive to the links&mdash;and look things over.</p>

<p>Oh, what a world it is&mdash;this world of Washington
when Winter welcomes, for the moment,
Spring!</p>

<p>Evans wished that Jane were there to see. To
let him buy flowers for her&mdash;ices. He wondered if
the time would come when he might buy her a
spring hat. Well, why not? If things went like
this with him! He knew he was getting back. He
could see it in the eyes of women. Where once
there had been pity&mdash;was now coquettish challenge.
He was having invitations. He accepted only a
few, but they came increasingly.</p>

<p>And clients came. Not many, but enough to
point the way to success. He had sold more of the
old books. His mother&#8217;s milk farm was becoming a
fashionable fad.</p>

<p>Edith Towne had helped to bring Mrs. Follette&#8217;s
wares before her friends. At all hours of the day
they drove out, Edith with them. &#8220;It is such an
adorable place,&#8221; she told Evans, &#8220;and your&mdash;mother!
Isn&#8217;t she absolutely herself? Selling
milk with that empress air of hers. I simply love
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Evans liked Edith Towne immensely. Even
more than Baldy he divined her loneliness. &#8220;In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
that great house there isn&#8217;t a soul for real companionship.
Towne&#8217;s eaten up with egotism, and
the cousin is an echo.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edith asked herself out to dinner very often.
&#8220;It is perfect with just the four of us,&#8221; she told
Mrs. Follette, and that lady, flattered almost to
tears, said, &#8220;Telephone whenever you can come and
take pot-luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edith had planned to have dinner with them to-night.
Evans took an early train to Sherwood.
When he reached home Edith and his mother were
on the porch and the Towne car stood before the
gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to go back,&#8221; Edith explained. &#8220;Uncle
Fred came in from Chicago an hour or two ago
and telephoned that he must see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Baldy will be broken-hearted,&#8221; Evans told her,
smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t get him up. I tried, but they said
he had left the office. I thought I&#8217;d bring him out
with me.&#8221; She kissed Mrs. Follette. &#8220;I&#8217;ll come
again soon, dear lady. And you must tell me
when you are tired of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Evans went to the car with her, and came back
to find his mother in an exalted mood. &#8220;Now if
you could marry a girl like Edith Towne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Edith</i>,&#8221; he laughed lightly. &#8220;Mother, are you
blind? She and Baldy are mad about each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course she isn&#8217;t serious. A boy like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she? I&#8217;ll say she is.&#8221; Evans went charging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
up the stairs to dress for dinner. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be down
presently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Baldy may be late; we won&#8217;t wait for him,&#8221; his
mother called after him.</p>

<p>The dining-room at Castle Manor had a bare
waxed floor, an old drop-leaf table of dark mahogany,
deer&#8217;s antlers over the mantel, and some candles
in sconces.</p>

<p>Old Mary did her best to follow the rather formal
service on which Mrs. Follette insisted. The food
was simple, but well-cooked, and there was always
a soup and a salad.</p>

<p>It was not until they reached the salad course
that they heard the sound of Baldy&#8217;s car. He
burst in at the front door, as if he battered it down,
stormed through the hall, and entered the dining-room
like a whirlwind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane&#8217;s going to be married,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;and
she&#8217;s going to marry Frederick Towne!&#8221;</p>

<p>Evans half-rose from his chair. Everything
turned black and he sat down. There was a loud
roaring in his ears. It was like taking ether&mdash;with
the darkness and the roaring.</p>

<p>When things cleared he found that neither his
mother nor Baldy had noticed his agitation. His
mother was asking quick questions. &#8220;Who told
you? Does Edith know?&#8221;</p>

<p>Baldy threw himself in a chair. &#8220;Mr. Towne
got back from Chicago this afternoon. Called me
up and said he wanted me to come over at once to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
his office. I went, and he gave me a letter from
Jane. Said he thought it was better for him to
bring it, and then he could explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw the note across the table to Mrs. Follette.
&#8220;Will you read it? I&#8217;m all in. Drove like
the dickens coming out. Towne wanted me to go
home with him to dinner. Wanted to begin the
brother-in-law business right away before I got my
breath. But I left. Oh, the darned peacock!&#8221;
Jane would have known Baldy&#8217;s mood. The tempest-gray
eyes, the chalk-white face.</p>

<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you like it, Baldy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like it? Oh, read that note. Does it sound
like Jane? I ask you, does it sound like <i>Jane</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>It did not sound in the least like Jane. Not the
Jane that Evans and Baldy knew.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Baldy, dear. Mr. Towne will tell you all about
it. I am going to marry him as soon as Judy is
better. I know you will be surprised, but Mr.
Towne is just wonderful, and it will be such a
good thing for all of us. Mr. Towne will tell you
how dreadfully ill Judy is. He wants to do everything
for her, and that will be such a help to Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so we will live happy ever after. Oh, you
blessed boy, you know how I love you. Send a
wire, and say that it is all right. Tell Evans and
Mrs. Follette. They are my dearest friends and
will always be.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>She signed herself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right"><span class="gap">&#8220;Loving you more than ever,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>Mrs. Follette looked up from the letter, took off
her reading glasses, and said complacently, &#8220;I
think it is very nice for her.&#8221; The dear lady quite
basked in the thought of her intimate friendship
with the fiance of Frederick Towne.</p>

<p>But the two men did not bask.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Nice, for Jane?</i>&#8221; they threw the sentences at
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, can&#8217;t you see why she has done it?&#8221; Baldy
demanded. He caught up the note, pointing an
accusing finger as he read certain phrases. &#8220;<i>It
will be such a good thing for all of us ... he
wants to do everything for her ... it will be
such a help to Bob....</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t that show,&#8221; Baldy demanded furiously,
&#8220;she&#8217;s doing it because Judy and Bob are hard up
and Towne can help&mdash;I know Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>Evans knew her. Hadn&#8217;t he said to her not long
ago, &#8220;You&#8217;d tie up the broken wings of every
wounded bird.... You&#8217;d give crutches to the
lame, and food to the hungry....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you should object,&#8221; Mrs. Follette
was saying; &#8220;it will be a fine thing for her.
She will be Mrs. Frederick Towne!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather have her Jane Barnes for the rest
of her life. Do you know Towne&#8217;s reputation?
Any woman can flatter him into a love affair. A
fat Lothario.&#8221; Baldy did not mince the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he hasn&#8217;t married any of them,&#8221; said Mrs.
Follette triumphantly. She held to the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
and honorable theory that the woman a man marries
need not worry about past love affairs since
she had been paid the compliment of at least legal
permanency.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Jane,&#8221; Baldy said, brokenly, &#8220;you know
her. She&#8217;s a child, a darling child. With all her
dreams&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He ran his fingers through his hair
with the effect of a ruffled eagle.</p>

<p>Evans&#8217; lips were dry. &#8220;What did you say to
Towne?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what <i>could</i> I say? That I was surprised,
and all that. Something about hoping they&#8217;d be
happy. Then I beat it and got here as fast as I
could. I had to talk it over with you people
or&mdash;burst.&#8221; His eyes met Evans&#8217; and found
there the sympathy he sought. &#8220;It&#8217;s a rotten
trick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Evans, &#8220;rotten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Mrs. Follette, &#8220;that you must
both see it is best.&#8221; Yet her voice was troubled.
Through her complacency had penetrated the
thought of what Jane&#8217;s engagement might mean to
Evans. Yet, it might, on the other hand, be a blessing
in disguise. There were other women, richer&mdash;who
would help him in his career. And in time
he would forget Jane.</p>

<p>Old Mary gave them their coffee. &#8220;Shall we
walk for a bit, Baldy?&#8221; Evans said, when at last
they rose.</p>

<p>The two men made their way towards the pine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
grove. The twilight sky was a deep purple with a
thin sickle of a moon and a breathless star.</p>

<p>And there in the little grove under the purple
sky Evans said to Baldy, &#8220;I love her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know. I wish to God you had her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps she has chosen wisely. Towne can
make things&mdash;easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you should hear what Edith says about
him. He&#8217;s an old grouch around the house. And
you know Janey? Like a bird&mdash;singing.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Like a bird singing!</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Baldy,&#8221; Evans said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t agree with you
that it was&mdash;the money. That may have helped in
her decision. But I think she cares&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For Towne&mdash;nonsense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t nonsense. She knows nothing of love.
She may have taken the shadow for the substance.
And he can be very&mdash;charming.&#8221; It wrung his
heart to say it. But almost with clairvoyance he
saw the truth.</p>

<p>When they returned to the house Baldy found a
message from Edith. He was to call her up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle Frederick has just told me,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;that Jane is to be my aunt. Isn&#8217;t it joyful?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Towne&#8217;s all right. But not for Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see. But he&#8217;s really in love with her, poor
old duck. Talked about it all through dinner.
He&#8217;s going to try awfully hard to make her happy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>&#8220;Then you approve?&#8221;</p>

<p>He heard her gay laugh over the wire. &#8220;It will
be nice&mdash;to have you&mdash;in the family. I&#8217;ll be your
niece-in-law.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be nothing of the kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t help being&mdash;Uncle Baldy. Isn&#8217;t that&mdash;delicious?
And now, will you come in to-night
and sit by my fire? Uncle Frederick is out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve sat too often by your fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too often for your own peace of mind? I
know that. And I&#8217;m glad of it.&#8221; Again he heard
a ripple of laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t a thing to laugh at.&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated, then said in a different tone, &#8220;I
am not laughing. But I want you by my fire to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was late when Evans went up-stairs. He had
spent the evening with his mother, discussing with
her some matters where his legal knowledge helped.
They did not speak of Jane. Their avoidance of
the subject showed their preoccupation with it.
But neither dared approach it.</p>

<p>On the bedside table in Evans&#8217; room lay the
valentine he had bought for Jane. There it was,
with its cupids and bleeding hearts&mdash;its forget-me-nots&mdash;and
golden darts.</p>

<p>Of course he could not send it now. He couldn&#8217;t
ever send another valentine to Jane. She belonged
to Towne.</p>

<p>It didn&#8217;t seem credible. It was one of the things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>&mdash;like
war&mdash;that men refused to believe could ever
happen. Yet it had happened.</p>

<p>After this Jane would be out of his life&mdash;utterly.
It was all very well to talk of friendship. But he
wouldn&#8217;t be her friend. He didn&#8217;t want to see her.
He didn&#8217;t want to hear her voice. He thought he
should die when he had to meet her as Mrs. Frederick
Towne.</p>

<p>But what was he going to do without her?
What...?</p>

<p>He paced the room restlessly. Ahead of him had
been always the hope that he might win her. And
now, she was won, and not by him. It was&mdash;unthinkable.</p>

<p>His excitement increased. The valentine seemed
to mock him as it lay there fragile in its loveliness.</p>

<p>He reached out his hand for it and tore it into
shreds. Paper lace!... Paper lace!...</p>

<small>VOICES IN THE DARK</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Arthur Lane</span> and Sandy talked it over. &#8220;I
wonder what has happened. He looks dreadful.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two boys were on their way to Castle Manor.
They wanted books. Evans&#8217; library was a treasure-house
for youthful readers. It had all the old adventuring
tales. And Evans had read everything.
He would simply walk up to a shelf, lay his hand
on a book, and say, &#8220;Here&#8217;s one you&#8217;ll like.&#8221; And
he was never wrong.</p>

<p>He had told them that the latch-string was always
out for them. And they had learned to look
for his welcome. Sometimes he asked them to stay,
and &#8217;phoned to their parents. And then they
popped corn before the library fire, or made taffy
in the kitchen. And sometimes Baldy Barnes was
there and that wonderful Miss Towne. And Mrs.
Follette. The boys didn&#8217;t care in the least what
the rest of Sherwood thought about Mrs. Follette.
They liked her and when she made the taffy and
stood over the boiling kettle with the big spoon in
her hand, they thought her regal in spite of the
humble nature of her occupation.</p>

<p>But of late, Evans Follette had met them with an
effort. &#8220;Look for yourselves,&#8221; he had said, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
they asked for books, and had sat staring into the
fire. And he had not urged them to stay. His
manner had been kind but inattentive. They were
puzzled and a little hurt. &#8220;I feel sorta queer when
he acts that way,&#8221; Sandy was saying, &#8220;as if he
didn&#8217;t take any interest. I don&#8217;t even know
whether he wants us any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arthur refused to believe his hero inhospitable.
&#8220;It&#8217;s just that he&#8217;s got things on his mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>They reached the house and rang the bell. Old
Mary let them in. &#8220;He&#8217;s in the library,&#8221; she said,
and they went towards it. The door was open and
they entered. But the room was empty....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That morning Baldy had had a letter from Jane
and had handed it to Evans. It was the first long
letter since her engagement to Towne. Baldy had
written to his sister, flamingly, demanding to know
if she was really happy. And she had said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I shall be when Judy is better. That is all I
can think of just now. Her life is hanging in the
balance. We can never be thankful enough that
we got the specialist when we did. He had found
the trouble. The question now is whether she will
have the strength for another operation. When
she gets through with that! Well, then I&#8217;ll talk to
you, darling. I hardly know how I feel. The days
are so whirling. Mr. Towne has been more than
generous. If the little I can give him will repay
him, then I must give it, dearest. And it won&#8217;t be
hard. He is so very good to me.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>And now this letter had come after Towne&#8217;s second
visit:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Baldy, dear, I am very happy. And I want
you to set your mind at rest. I am not marrying
Mr. Towne for what he has done for us all, but because
I love him. Please believe it. You can&#8217;t
understand what he has been to me in these dark
days. I have learned to know how kind he is&mdash;and
how strong. I haven&#8217;t a care in the world
when he is here, and everything is so&mdash;marvellous.
You should see my ring&mdash;a great sapphire, Baldy,
in a square of diamonds. He is crazy to buy things
for me, but I won&#8217;t let him. I will take things for
Judy but not for myself. You can see that, of
course. I just go everywhere with him in my cheap
little frocks, to the theatres and to all the great
restaurants, and we have the most delectable things
to eat. It is really great fun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Judy is so happy over the whole thing, that it
is helping her to get well. She says she was half
afraid to advise me, but she knew it was for my
happiness. Bob simply walks on air. He says
when business grows better, he will pay back every
cent to Mr. Towne. And of course he must. But
we haven&#8217;t any of us been made to feel that we
ought to be grateful. Mr. Towne says that he simply
held out a friendly hand when we needed it,
and that&#8217;s all there is to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, dearest dear, I wish I could hear Philomel
sing o&#8217; mornings, and see Merrymaid and the
kit-cat on the hearth, but best of all would be to
have your own darling self on the other side of the
table.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>Since he had heard the news of Jane&#8217;s approaching
marriage, Evans had lived in a dream. The
people about him had seemed shadow-shapes. He
had walked and talked with them, remembering
nothing afterward but his great weariness. He
had eaten his meals at stated times, and had not
known what he was eating. He had gone to his
office, and behind closed doors had sat at his desk,
staring.</p>

<p>Nothing mattered. All incentive was gone. He
spoke of Jane to no one. Not even to his mother.
He had a morbid horror of hearing her name.
When he came across anything that reminded him
of her, he suffered actual physical pain.</p>

<p>And now this letter! &#8220;You see what she says,&#8221;
Baldy had raged. &#8220;Of course she isn&#8217;t in love with
him. But she thinks she is. There&#8217;s nothing more
that I can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Evans had taken the letter to the library to read.
He was alone, except for Rusty, who had limped
after him and laid at his feet.</p>

<p>She loved&mdash;Towne. And that settled it. &#8220;I am
marrying Mr. Towne because I love him.&#8221; Nothing
could be plainer than that. Baldy might protest.
But the words were there.</p>

<p>As Evans sat gazing into the fire, he saw her as
she had so often been in this old room&mdash;as a child,
sprawled on the hearth-rug over some entrancing
book from his shelves, swinging her feet on the
edge of a table while he bragged of his athletic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
prowess; leaning over war-maps, while he pointed
out the fields of fighting; curled up in a corner on
the couch while he read to her&mdash;&#8220;<i>Oh, silver shrine,
here will I take my rest....</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>He could stand his thoughts no longer. Without
hat or heavy coat, he stepped through one of the
long windows and into the night.</p>

<p>As he walked on in the darkness, he had no
knowledge of his destination. He swept on and
on, pursued by dreadful thoughts.</p>

<p>On and on through the blackness.... No
moon ... a wet wind blowing ... on
and on....</p>

<p>He came to a bridge which crossed a culvert.
No water flowed under it. But down the road
which led through the Glen was another bridge,
and beneath it a deep, still pool.</p>

<p>With the thought of that deep and quiet pool
came momentary relief from the horrors which had
hounded him. It would be easy. A second&#8217;s struggle.
Then everything over. Peace. No fears. No
dread of the future....</p>

<p>It seemed a long time after, that, leaning against
the buttress of the bridge, he heard, with increasing
clearness, the sound of boys&#8217; voices in the dark.</p>

<p>He drew back among the shadows. It was Sandy
and Arthur. Not three feet away from him&mdash;passing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of course, Mr. Follette is just a man,&#8221;
Sandy was saying.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>&#8220;Maybe he is,&#8221; Arthur spoke earnestly, &#8220;but I
don&#8217;t know. There&#8217;s something about him&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; Sandy urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, something&#8221;&mdash;Arthur was struggling to
express himself, &#8220;splendid. It shines like a
light&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Their brisk footsteps left the bridge, and were
dulled by the dirt road beyond. Sandy&#8217;s response
was inaudible. A last murmur, and then silence.</p>

<p>Evans was swept by a wave of emotion; his heart,
warm and alive, began to beat in the place where
there had been frozen emptiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Something splendid&mdash;that shines like a light!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Years afterward he spoke of this moment to
Jane. &#8220;I can&#8217;t describe it. It was a miracle&mdash;their
coming. As much of a miracle as that light
which shone on Paul as he rode to Damascus. The
change within me was absolute. I was born again.
All the old fears slipped from me like a garment.
I was saved, Jane, by those boys&#8217; voices in the
dark.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next day was Sunday. Evans called up
Sandy and Arthur and invited them to supper.
&#8220;Old Mary said you were here last night, and
didn&#8217;t find me. I&#8217;ve a book or two for you. Can
you come and get them? And stay to supper.
Miss Towne will be here and her uncle.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys could not know that they were asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
as a shield and buckler in the battle which Evans
was fighting. It seemed to him that he could not
meet Frederick Towne. Yet it had been, of course,
the logical thing to ask him. Edith had invited
herself, and Towne had, of course, much to tell
about Jane.</p>

<p>Evans, therefore, with an outward effect of tranquillity,
played the host. After supper, however, he
took the boys with him to the library.</p>

<p>On the table lay a gray volume. He opened it
and showed the Cruikshank illustrations.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been reading this. It&#8217;s great stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress,&#8221; said Sandy; &#8220;do you
like it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Evans leaned above the book where it
lay open under the light. &#8220;Listen:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Then Apollyon, espying his opportunity, began
to gather up close to Christian, and wrestling with
him, gave him a dreadful fall: and with that, Christian&#8217;s
sword flew out of his hand. Then said
Apollyon, <i>I am sure of thee now</i>: and with that, he
had almost prest him to death, so that Christian
began to despair of life. But as God would have
it, while Apollyon was fetching of his last blow,
thereby to make a full end of this good Man, Christian
nimbly reached out his hand for his Sword,
and caught it, saying, <i>Rejoice not against me, O
mine Enemy! when I fall, I shall arise</i>: and with
that, gave him a deadly thrust, which made him
give back, as one that had received his mortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
wound: Christian perceiving that, made at him
again saying, <i>Nay, in all these things we are more
than Conquerors, through him that loved us.</i> And
with that, Apollyon spread forth his Dragon&#8217;s
wings, and sped him away, that Christian saw him
no more.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Evans&#8217; ringing voice gave full value to the words.
It seemed to Arthur, worshipping his hero, as if
he flung a hurled defiance at some unseen foe&mdash;&#8220;<i>Rejoice
not against me, O mine Enemy! when I
fall, I shall arise!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet when he looked up from the book Evans&#8217; eyes
were smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you like to take it home with you? It
is a rare edition, but you know how to handle it.
And I&#8217;d like to have you read it. Some day you
may meet Apollyon. And may find it helpful. As
I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later as the boys walked home together, the
precious volume under Arthur&#8217;s arm, Sandy said,
&#8220;He&#8217;s more like himself, isn&#8217;t he? More pep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say he is,&#8221; but Arthur was not satisfied.
&#8220;I wish he&#8217;d told us what he meant when he talked
about meeting Apollyon.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That night Evans found out for the first time
something about his mother. &#8220;You look tired,
dearest,&#8221; he had said, when their guests were gone,
and he and she had come into the great hall together.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>&#8220;I am tired.&#8221; She sat down on an old horsehair
sofa. &#8220;I can&#8217;t stand much excitement. It makes
me feel like an old lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never grow old.&#8221; He felt a deep tenderness
for her in this moment of confessed weakness.
She had always been so strong. Had refused to
lean. She had, in fact, taken from him his son&#8217;s
prerogative of protectiveness.</p>

<p>He laid his hand on her shoulder. &#8220;You&#8217;d better
see Hallam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My heart&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her in alarm. &#8220;Mother! Why
didn&#8217;t you tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the use? There&#8217;s nothing to be worried
about. Only he says I must not push myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am worried. Let me look after the men in
the morning early. That will give you an extra
nap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I won&#8217;t do it, Evans. You have your
work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t hurt me. And I am going to boss you
around a bit.&#8221; He stooped and kissed her. &#8220;You
are too precious to lose, Mumsie.&#8221;</p>

<p>She clung to him. &#8220;What would I do without
you, my dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>He helped her up the stairs. And as she climbed
slowly, his arm about her, he thought of that dark
moment by the bridge.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>If those young voices had not come to him in the
night, this loving soul might have been stricken
and made desolate; left alone in her time of greatest
need.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>AT THE OLD INN</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> more the Washington papers had headlines
that spoke of Delafield Simms. He had married
a stenographer in Frederick Towne&#8217;s office. And
it was Towne&#8217;s niece that he had deserted at the
altar.</p>

<p>And most remarkable of all, Edith Towne had
been at the wedding. It was Eloise Harper who
told the reporters.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were married at the old Inn below Alexandria
this morning, by the local Methodist clergyman.
Miss Logan is a Methodist&mdash;fancy. And
Edith was bridesmaid.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Eloise did not know that Lucy had worn the
wedding dress and veil that Edith had given her
and looked lovely in them. And that after the
ceremony, Delafield had wrung Edith&#8217;s hand and
had said, &#8220;I shall never know how to thank you
for what you have been to Lucy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edith&#8217;s candid eyes had met his squarely. &#8220;You
know you are not half good enough for her, Del,&#8221;
and he had said, humbly, &#8220;I&#8217;m not and that&#8217;s the
truth. But I am going to do my darndest to be
what she thinks I am.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>Martha and her husband had served a delicious
breakfast in the big empty dining-room. Only
Edith and Baldy were there besides the bride and
groom. Lucy had very sensibly refused to have
any fuss and feathers. &#8220;If it is quiet, people won&#8217;t
have so much to say about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delafield&#8217;s manner to Lucy was perfect. &#8220;What
do you think she has made me do?&#8221; he asked Edith.
&#8220;Buy a farm in Virginia. We are going to raise
pigs&mdash;black Berkshires, because Lucy likes the
slant of their ears and the curl of their tails. She
has been reading books about them, and we are
going to spend our honeymoon motoring around
the country and buying stock.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oh, bravo, bravo, little Lucy, not to risk boring
this fashionable young husband with a conventional
honeymoon! Edith wanted to clap her hands. But
she made no sign, except to meet Lucy&#8217;s quiet
glance with a lift of the eyebrows.</p>

<p>Edith and Baldy lingered after the bride and
groom had driven off in a great gray car&mdash;bound
for the Virginia country place which Delafield had
bought, and made ready for the occupancy in the
twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, but you&#8217;re superlative,&#8221; Baldy told her as
they walked in the garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. And the way you carried it off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t carry it off. It carried itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure it didn&#8217;t hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>She smiled at him from beneath her big hat.
&#8220;Not a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>The box hedges in the garden were showing a
hint of new green. There was a plum tree blooming
prematurely. The sun made brown shadows
along the river&#8217;s edge, and the wash of the waves
from passing steamers went lip-lapping among the
reeds and rushes.</p>

<p>The moment was ripe for romance. But Baldy
almost feverishly kept the conversation away from
serious things. They had talked seriously enough,
God knew, the other night by Edith&#8217;s fire. He had
seen her lonely in the thought of her future.</p>

<p>&#8220;When Uncle Fred marries I won&#8217;t stay here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had yearned to take her in his arms, to tell
her that against his heart she should never again
know loneliness. But he had not dared. What
had he to offer? A boy&#8217;s love. Against her
gold.</p>

<p>He told himself with some bitterness that one
fortune was enough in a family. Jane&#8217;s engagement
had changed things for her brother. The antagonism
which Baldy had always felt for Frederick
was intensified. The thought of Towne&#8217;s
money weighed heavily upon him. Jane had already
placed herself under insuperable obligations.
Even if she wished, she could not now shake herself
free.</p>

<p>And Edith&#8217;s money? He and Jane living on the
Towne millions? He wouldn&#8217;t have it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>So he talked of Jane. &#8220;She doesn&#8217;t want her
engagement announced until she gets back. I
think she&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; Edith said lazily. &#8220;If I loved a man
I&#8217;d want to shout it to the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were sitting on a rustic bench under the
blossoming plum tree. Edith&#8217;s hands were clasped
behind her head, and the winged sleeves of her
gown fell back and showed her bare arms. Baldy
wanted to unclasp those hands, crush them to his
lips&mdash;but instead he stood up, looking over the
river.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see the ducks out there? Wild ones at
that. It&#8217;s a sign of spring.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose and stood beside him. &#8220;And you can
talk of&mdash;ducks&mdash;on a day like this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he did not look at her, &#8220;ducks are&mdash;safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>He heard her low laugh. &#8220;Silly boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned, his gray eyes filled with limpid light.
&#8220;Perhaps I am. But I should be a fool if I told
you how I love you. Worship you. You know it,
of course. But nothing can come of it, even if I
were presumptuous enough to think that you&mdash;care.&#8221;</p>

<p>She swept out her hands in an appealing gesture.
&#8220;Say it. I want to hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was adorable. But he drew back a little.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve gone too far and too fast. It is my fault,
of course, for being a romantic fool.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;re a pair of romantic fools,
Baldy.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned and put his hands on her shoulders.
&#8220;Edith, I&mdash;mustn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not until I have something to offer you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have something to offer&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know what you mean. But&mdash;I won&#8217;t.
Somehow this affair of Jane&#8217;s with your uncle has
made me see&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how the world would look at it. How
<i>he&#8217;d</i> look at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle Frederick? He hasn&#8217;t anything to do
with it. I&#8217;m my own mistress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know. But&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I can&#8217;t analyze it,
Edith. I love you&mdash;no end. More than&mdash;anything.
But I won&#8217;t ask you to marry me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know how selfish you are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know how wise I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made an impatient gesture. &#8220;You&#8217;re not
thinking of me in the least. You are thinking of
your pride.&#8221;</p>

<p>He caught her hand in his. &#8220;I <i>am</i> thinking of
my pride. Do you suppose it is easy for me to let
Jane&mdash;take money from him? To feel that there
is no man in our family who can pay the bills? I
am proud. And I&#8217;m glad of it. Edith&mdash;I want you
to be glad that I won&#8217;t take&mdash;alms.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her wise eyes studied him for a moment. &#8220;You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
blessed boy. You blessed poet,&#8221; she sighed, &#8220;I am
proud of you, but my heart aches&mdash;for myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>He caught her almost roughly in his arms and in
a moment released her. &#8220;I&#8217;m right, dearest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re not right. If we married, we&#8217;d sail
to Italy and have a villa by the sea. And you
would paint masterpieces. Do you think my
money counts beside your talent? Well, I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, let me prove my talent first. As
things are now, I couldn&#8217;t pay our passage to the
other side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could. My money would be yours&mdash;your
talent mine. A fair exchange.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stuck obstinately to his point of view. &#8220;I
won&#8217;t tie you to any promise until I&#8217;ve proved myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ll lose all these shining years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t lose a moment. I&#8217;m going to work
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was, she perceived, on the heights. But she
knew the weariness of the climb.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Coming out of the garden in the late afternoon,
they were aware of other arrivals at the Inn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adelaide and Uncle Fred, by all the gods,&#8221; said
Edith, as they peered into the dining-room from
the dimness of the hall. &#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t let them see
us. Adelaide&#8217;s such a bromide.&#8221;</p>

<p>They crept out, found Baldy&#8217;s car and sped towards
the city. &#8220;I should say,&#8221; Baldy proclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
sternly, &#8220;that for a man who is engaged, a thing
like that is unspeakable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Uncle Fred and Adelaide,&#8221; said Edith,
easily; &#8220;she probably asked him. And she was
plaintive. A plaintive woman always gets her
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adelaide had been plaintive. And she had hinted
for the ride. &#8220;Why not an afternoon ride, Ricky?
It would rest you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry. But I&#8217;m tied up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen you for ages, Ricky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, old girl. I&#8217;ve had a thousand things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve&mdash;missed you.&#8221;</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t easy for Frederick to ignore that.
Adelaide was an attractive woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well. I can get away at four. We&#8217;ll have
tea at the old Inn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavenly. Ricky, I have a new blue hat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could always wear blue.&#8221; He decided that
he might as well make things pleasant. There was
a shock in store for her. Of course he&#8217;d have to
tell her about Jane.</p>

<p>So Adelaide in the new blue hat&mdash;with a wrap
that matched&mdash;with that porcelain white and pink
of her complexion&mdash;with her soft voice, and appealing
manner, had Frederick for three whole
hours to herself.</p>

<p>She told him all the spicy gossip. Frederick,
like most men, ostensibly scorned scandal, but lent
a willing ear. What Eloise had said, what Benny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
had said, what all the world was saying about Del&#8217;s
marriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;And they were married here to-day. I didn&#8217;t
dream it until Eloise called me up just before
lunch. Edith had told her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Edith was here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and young Barnes.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped there and poured the tea. She did
it gracefully, but Frederick&#8217;s thoughts swept back
to Jane behind her battlements of silver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Four lumps, Ricky?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um&mdash;yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A penny for your thoughts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not worth a penny, Adelaide. Lots of
lemon, please. And no cakes. I am trying to
keep my lovely figure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, why worry? I like big men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nice of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martha&#8217;s little sponge cakes were light as a
feather. Adelaide broke one and ate daintily.
Then she said, &#8220;How&#8217;s little Jane Barnes?&#8221;</p>

<p>Frederick was immediately self-conscious.
&#8220;She&#8217;s still in Chicago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sister better?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When is she coming back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane? As soon as Mrs. Heming can be brought
home. In a few weeks, I hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adelaide drank a cup of tea almost at a draught.
She was aware of an impending disclosure. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
the blow came, she took it without the flicker of an
eyelash.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to marry Jane Barnes, Adelaide.
The engagement isn&#8217;t to be announced until she
returns to Washington. But I want my friends to
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>She put her elbows on the table, clasped her
hands and rested her chin on them looking at
him with steady eyes. &#8220;So that&#8217;s the end of it,
Ricky?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The end of what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our friendship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should it be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do you think that your little Jane is going
to let you philander?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t want to philander. If that&#8217;s the way
you put it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you think you&#8217;re in&mdash;love with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I am,&#8221; the red came up in his cheeks,
but he stuck to it manfully. &#8220;It&#8217;s different from
anything&mdash;ever that I&#8217;ve felt before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They all say that, don&#8217;t they, every time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so&mdash;cynical.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. &#8220;I&#8217;m not. Well, I
shall miss you, Ricky, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was all, just that plaintive note. But Adelaide&#8217;s
plaintiveness was always effective.</p>

<p>So after tea they walked in the garden, and sat
under the plum tree, and looked out upon the river&mdash;where
the shadows were rose-red in the setting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
sun, and Adelaide said, &#8220;My life is like that&mdash;my
sun has set.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frederick reached out a sympathetic hand.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that, old girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adelaide lifted his hand to her cheek. &#8220;This is
really &#8216;good-bye,&#8217; isn&#8217;t it, Ricky? It seems rather
queer to be saying it.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>SPRING COMES TO SHERWOOD</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span> was home again. Judy was better. Philomel
sang. The world was a lovely place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but it&#8217;s good to be back,&#8221; Jane was telling
Baldy at breakfast. The windows were wide open,
the fragrance of lilacs streamed in, there were pink
hyacinths on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s heavenly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baldy smiled at her. &#8220;The same old Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head, and the light in her eyes
wavered as if some breath of doubt fanned it.
&#8220;Not quite. The winter hasn&#8217;t been easy. I&#8217;m a
thousand years older.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And with a wedding day ahead of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Do you like it, Baldy?&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair and surveyed her.
&#8220;Not a bit&mdash;if you want the truth&mdash;I shall be
jealous of Mr. Frederick Towne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silly. You know I shall never love anybody
more than you, Baldy.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was perfectly unconscious of the revelation
she was making, but he knew&mdash;and was constrained
to say, &#8220;Then you don&#8217;t really love him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I do. He&#8217;s much nicer than I imagined he
might be.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, well, if you think you are going to be
happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I am&mdash;dearest,&#8221; she blew a kiss from
the tips of her fingers. &#8220;Baldy, I&#8217;m going to have
a great house with a great garden&mdash;and invite Judy
and the babies&mdash;every summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Towne&#8217;s not marrying Judy and the babies.
He&#8217;s marrying you. He won&#8217;t want all of your
poor relations hanging around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he will. He has been simply dear. I feel
as if I can never do enough for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was very much in earnest. Baldy refrained
from further criticism lest he cloud the happiness
of her home-coming. The thing was done. They
might as well make the best of it. So he said, &#8220;Do
you always call him &#8216;Mr. Towne&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He scolds, but I can&#8217;t say Frederick&mdash;or
Fred. He begs me to do it&mdash;but I tell him to wait
till we&#8217;re married and then I&#8217;ll say &#8216;dear.&#8217; Most
wives do that, don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope mine won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall want my wife to invent names for me,
and if she can&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll do it for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane opened her eyes wide. &#8220;Romance with a
big R, Baldy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course. I should want to be king, lover,
master&mdash;friend to the woman who cared for me.
That&#8217;s the real thing, Janey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it?&#8221; But she did not follow the subject up;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
she drew another cup of coffee for herself, and
asked finally, &#8220;When is Evans coming back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for several days. He will go to Boston
when he finishes with New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see. And he&#8217;s much better?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say. You wouldn&#8217;t know him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose. &#8220;I must run on. We&#8217;re to dine at
Towne&#8217;s then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Just the five of us. It seems funny that I
haven&#8217;t met Cousin Annabel. But she&#8217;s able to
take her place at the head of the table, Mr. Towne
tells me. He told me, too, that she wants to meet
me. But I have a feeling that she won&#8217;t approve
of me, Baldy. I&#8217;m not fashionable enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should you be fashionable? You are all
right as you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I? Baldy, I believe my stock has gone up
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It hasn&#8217;t, Janey. You were always a darling.
But I didn&#8217;t want to spoil you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As if you could,&#8221; she smiled wistfully. &#8220;Sometimes
I have a feeling, Baldy, that I should like
life to go on just as it is. Just you and me, Baldy.
But of course it can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it can, if you wish it. You mustn&#8217;t
marry Towne if you have the least doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any doubts. So don&#8217;t worry.&#8221; She
stood up and kissed him. &#8220;Briggs will come out
for me&mdash;and we are all to see a play together afterward.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>&#8220;Edith told me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Baldy,&#8221; she had hold of the lapel of his coat,
&#8220;how are things going with&mdash;Edith?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean, am I in love with her? I
am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to marry her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God knows.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up at him in surprise. &#8220;What makes
you say it that way? Has she told you she didn&#8217;t
care?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has told me that she does care. But do
you think, Janey, that I&#8217;m going to take her
money?&#8221;</p>

<p>He patted her on the cheek and was off. She
went to the top of the terrace and watched him ride
away. Then she walked in the little shaded grove
behind the house. Merrymaid followed her and
the much-matured kitten. There was a carpet underfoot
of pine needles and of fragrant young
growth. Several of her old hens scratched in the
rich mould&mdash;and their broods of tiny chicks answering
the urgent mother-cry were like bits of
yellow down blown before a breeze.</p>

<p>Jane picked a spray of princess-pine and stuck it
in her blouse. Oh, what an adorable world! Her
world. Could there be anything better that Frederick
Towne could give her?</p>

<p>Baldy&#8217;s words rang in her ears&mdash;&#8220;Do you think
I am going to take her money?&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet she was taking Frederick Towne&#8217;s money.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
She wished it had not been necessary. Each day
it seemed to her that the thought burned deeper:
she was under obligations to her lover that could
be repaid only by marriage. And they were to be
married in June.</p>

<p>Yet why should the thought burn? She loved
him. Not, perhaps, as Baldy loved Edith. But
there were respect and admiration, yes, and when
she was with him, she felt his charm, she was carried
along on the whirling stream of his own adoration
and tenderness.</p>

<p>Yet&mdash;there were things to dread. She would
have to meet his friends. Be judged by them.
There would be formal entertaining. Edith had
said once that the demand of society on women
was really high-class drudgery. &#8220;Much worse
than washing dishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane didn&#8217;t quite believe that. Yet there must
be a happy medium. Her dreams had had to do
with a little house&mdash;a little garden.</p>

<p>She went back to her own little house, and found
a great box of roses waiting. She spent an hour
filling vases and bowls with them. Old Sophy
coming in from the kitchen said, &#8220;Looks lak dat
Mistuh Towne&#8217;s jes&#8217; fascinated with you, Miss
Janey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t the roses lovely, Sophy?&#8221; Jane wanted
to tell Sophy that Mr. Towne would some day be
her husband. But she still deferred the announcement
of her engagement.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told one or two people,&#8221; Frederick had
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Adelaide. She&#8217;s such an old friend. And
I told Annabel, of course. I don&#8217;t see why you
should care, Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;m afraid that when I go into a shop
someone will say, &#8216;Oh, she&#8217;s going to marry Frederick
Towne, and see how shabby she is.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are never shabby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because I made myself two new dresses
while I was at Judy&#8217;s. And this is one of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have the great art of looking lovely in the
simplest things. But some day you are going to
wear a frock that I have for you.&#8221; He told her
about the silver and blue creation he had bought in
Chicago. &#8220;Now and then I take it out and look at
it. I&#8217;ve put it in your room, Jane, and it is waiting
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She thought now of the blue and silver gown, as
Sophy said, &#8220;Miss Jane, I done pressed that w&#8217;ite
chiffon of yours twel it hardly hangs together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wear it once more, Sophy. I&#8217;m having a
sewing woman next week.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With the old white chiffon she wore a golden rose
or two&mdash;and sat at Frederick&#8217;s right, while on the
other end of the great table, Cousin Annabel
weighed her in the balance.</p>

<p>Jane knew she was being weighed. Cousin Annabel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
was so blue-blooded that it showed in the
veins of her hands and nose&mdash;and her hair was
dressed with a gray transformation which quite
overpowered her thin little face with its thin little
nose.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Cousin Annabel felt that
Frederick had taken leave of his senses. What
could he see in this short-haired girl&mdash;who hadn&#8217;t a
jewel, except the one he had given her?</p>

<p>Jane wore Towne&#8217;s ring, hidden, on a ribbon
around her neck. &#8220;Some day I&#8217;ll let everybody see
it,&#8221; she had said, &#8220;but not now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You act as if you were ashamed of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not. But Cinderella must wait until the
night of the ball.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was while they were drinking their coffee in
the drawing-room that the storm came up. It was
one of those cyclonic winds that whip off the tops
of the trees and blow the roofs from unsubstantial
edifices. The thunder was a ceaseless reverberation&mdash;the
lightning was pink and made the sky
seem like a glistening inverted shell.</p>

<p>Cousin Annabel hated thunder-storms and
said so. &#8220;I think I shall go to my room, Frederick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not a bit safer up there than here,&#8221;
Towne told her.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I feel safer, Frederick.&#8221; She was very decided
about it. What she meant to do was to sit in
the middle of her bed and have her maid give her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the smelling salts. She would be thus in a sense
fortified.</p>

<p>So she went up and Baldy and Edith wandered
across the hall to the library, where Edith insisted
they could observe other aspects of the storm.</p>

<p>Jane and her lover were left alone, and presently
Frederick was called to the telephone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that it&#8217;s safe, sir, in this storm,&#8221;
Waldron warned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Waldron,&#8221; Towne said, and stepped
quickly across the polished floor.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that Jane sat by herself in the
great drawing-room of the Ice Palace, while the
wind howled, and the rain streamed down the window
glass, and all the evil things in the world
seemed let loose.</p>

<p>And she was afraid!</p>

<p>Not of the storm, but of the great house. She
was so small and it was so big. Her own little cottage
clasped her in its warm embrace. This great
mansion stood away from her&mdash;as the sky stands
away from the desert. All the rest of her life she
would be going up and down those great stairs, sitting
in front of this great fireplace, presiding at the
far end of Frederick&#8217;s great table&mdash;dwarfed by it
all, losing personality, individuality, bidding good-bye
forever to little Jane Barnes, becoming until
death parted them the wife of Frederick Towne.</p>

<p>She sat huddled in her chair, panting a little, her
eyes wide.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>&#8220;Silly,&#8221; she said with a sob.</p>

<p>The sound of her voice echoed and rechoed,
&#8220;<i>Silly, silly, silly.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The noise without was deafening&mdash;the wind
shook the walls. She stood up, her hands clenched,
then ran swiftly into the hall.</p>

<p>A thundering crash and the lights went out.</p>

<p>She heard Frederick calling, &#8220;Jane, Jane!&#8221;</p>

<p>She called back, &#8220;I&#8217;m here,&#8221; and saw the quick
spurt of a match as he lighted it, holding it up and
peering into the dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;There you are, my dearest.&#8221; He lighted another
match and came towards her, as Waldron,
with a brace of candles, appeared in one door and
Baldy and Edith in another.</p>

<p>Frederick lifted Jane in his strong arms. &#8220;Why,
you&#8217;re crying,&#8221; he said; &#8220;don&#8217;t, my darling, don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Baldy came up and demanded, &#8220;What&#8217;s the
matter, Kitten? You&#8217;ve never been afraid of
storms.&#8221;</p>

<p>She tried to smile at him. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve gone
through such a lot lately.&#8221; But Baldy wasn&#8217;t satisfied.
A Jane who dissolved into tears was a disturbing
and desolating object. He glowered at
Frederick, holding him responsible.</p>

<p>At this moment Waldron reappeared to say that
Briggs had pronounced the streets impassable.
Branches had been blown down&mdash;and there was
other wreckage.</p>

<p>&#8220;That settles it,&#8221; Frederick said. &#8220;You two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
young things may as well stay here for the night.
Jane&#8217;s not fit to go out anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m all right,&#8221; she protested.</p>

<p>Edith suggested bridge, so they played for a
while. The big room was still lighted by the candles,
so that the shadows pressed close. Jane was
very pale, and now and then Frederick looked at
her anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;You and Edith had better go up,&#8221; he said at
last. &#8220;And you must have Alice get you some hot
milk&mdash;I&#8217;ll send Waldron with a bit of cordial to set
you up.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I want you to have it.&#8221; There was a note
of authority which almost brought her again to
tears. She hated to have anyone tell her what she
should do. She liked to do as she pleased. But
later, when the glass of cordial came up to her, she
drank it.</p>

<p>She did not go to sleep for a long time. Edith
sat by the bed and talked to her. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t,&#8221;
she apologized; &#8220;Uncle Fred told you to rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane curled up among her pillows, and said rebelliously,
&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t have to obey yet, do I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ever obey.&#8221; Edith, in her winged chair
with her Viking braids and the classic draperies of
her white dressing-gown, looked like a Norse goddess.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t ever obey, or you&#8217;ll make a tyrant
out of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I hate&mdash;fighting.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>&#8220;You won&#8217;t have to fight. I do it because it&#8217;s
my temperament. But you can manage him&mdash;by
letting things go a bit&mdash;and coaxing will do the
rest&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to manage&mdash;my husband,&#8221; said
Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;All women do&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you want to manage&mdash;Baldy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Edith flushed. &#8220;That&#8217;s different,&#8221; she evaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not different. You know you wouldn&#8217;t go
through life with him, pulling wires, making a puppet
of him&mdash;of yourself&mdash;you want comradeship&mdash;understanding.
You&#8217;ll flare up now and then.
Baldy and I do. But&mdash;oh, we love each other.&#8221;
Jane&#8217;s voice shook.</p>

<p>Edith looked at her thoughtfully. &#8220;Jane, are
you happy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to be&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired, I think. I don&#8217;t know. Ever since
I came home I&#8217;ve been nervous. Perhaps it is the
reaction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane, I&#8217;m going to say something. Don&#8217;t marry
Uncle Fred unless you&#8217;re&mdash;sure. I went through
all that with Del. And you see how little I knew
of what I had in my heart to give&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She
stopped, her lovely face suffused with blushes.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve learned&mdash;since then. And you mustn&#8217;t make
my&mdash;mistake. And, Jane dear,&#8221; she leaned over
the younger girl like some splendid angel, &#8220;don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
worry about material things. Baldy and I will
want you always with us&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane sat up. &#8220;Are you going to marry Baldy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; sighing a little, &#8220;some day, when his
ship comes in. He isn&#8217;t willing to share my cargo&mdash;yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He loves you,&#8221; said Jane, &#8220;dearly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edith bent down and kissed her. &#8220;I know,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;and my heart sings it.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Edith went away, they had not touched
again on the question of Jane&#8217;s marriage. Jane,
lying awake in the dark, reflected that of course
Edith could not know of her debt to Frederick.
No one knew except Baldy.</p>

<p>In the morning Towne had gone when Jane came
down. She and Edith had had breakfast in their
rooms&mdash;and there had been a great rose on Jane&#8217;s
tray, with a note twisted about the stem&mdash;&#8220;To my
golden girl.&#8221; Her lover had called her up by
the house telephone, and had told her he was leaving
for New York at noon. &#8220;A telegram has just
come. I&#8217;ll see you the moment I get back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane had a sense of relief. She would have three
days to herself. Three days at Sherwood&mdash;with
the blossoming trees, and the mating birds, and
Merrymaid and the kitten, and old Sophy with her
wise philosophy&mdash;and Baldy on the other side of
the little table&mdash;and Philomel singing....</p>

<p>Briggs took her out at noon, and Sophy came in
to say, &#8220;Mr. Evans called you-all up. He&#8217;s back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
fum New York. He say he&#8217;ll come over to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was news indeed! Old Evans! Jane got
into the frock of faded lilac gingham and went
about the house singing. Three days! Of freedom!</p>

<p>It was after lunch that she told the old woman,
&#8220;I&#8217;m going down in the Glen&mdash;there should be wild
honeysuckle&mdash;Sophy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sophy surveyed her. &#8220;The whole place is chock-full
of flowers, Miss Janey. And I&#8217;ll miss my guess
effen dey ain&#8217; mo&#8217; of &#8217;em dis afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;wild honeysuckle, Sophy? The florists
haven&#8217;t that for me, have they?&#8221;</p>

<p>So Jane put on a wide-brimmed hat, and away
she went down the long road with the pines on each
side of it&mdash;the wide creek, which washed in shallow
ripples over the brown stones, or eddied in still
pools under the great old willows.</p>

<p>There were bees in the Glen and butterflies, and
a cool silence. On the other side of the creek were
pasture, and cattle grazing. But no human creature
was in sight. Jane, walking along the narrow
path, had a sense of utter peace. Here was familiar
ground. She felt the welcome of inanimate
things&mdash;the old willows, the singing stream, the
great gray rocks that stuck their heads above the
edges of the bank.</p>

<p>On the slope of the bank she saw the rosiness of
the flowers she sought. She climbed up, picked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
fragrant sprays and sat down under a hickory tree
to make a bouquet. From where she sat she could
view the broad stream and a rustic bridge just at a
turn of the path.</p>

<p>And now, around the turn of the path, came suddenly
a man and two boys. They carried fishing-rods
and stopped at a jutting rock to bait their
hooks. One of the boys went out on the bridge and
cast his line. His voice came to Jane clearly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Follette, there&#8217;s a thing I hate to do, and
that&#8217;s to bait my hook with a worm. I&#8217;d much
rather put on something that wasn&#8217;t alive. Why is
it that everything eats up something else?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane peered down at the man poised on the rock.
It <i>was</i> Evans! He was winding his reel against a
taut line. &#8220;I&#8217;ve caught a snag,&#8221; he said; &#8220;look out,
Sandy, there&#8217;s something on your hook.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they landed the small catch with much excitement,
Jane was aware of the strong swing of
Evans&#8217; figure, the brown of his cheeks, the brightness
of his glance as he spoke to the boys.</p>

<p>He gave the death stroke to the silver flapping
fish with a jab of his knife-blade, and the boy on the
bridge complained, &#8220;There you are, killing things.
I don&#8217;t like it, do you? Everything we eat? The
woods are full of killing. It is dreadful when we
think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is dreadful.&#8221; Evans sat down on the rock
and looked across at the boy on the bridge. &#8220;But
there are more dreadful things than death&mdash;injustice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
and cruelty, and hate. And more than all&mdash;fear.
And you must think of this, Arthur, that
what we call a violent death is sometimes the easiest.
An old animal with teeth gone, trying to exist.
That&#8217;s dreadfulness. Or an old person racked by
pains. Much better if both could have been dead
in the glory of youth.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had always had that quick and vivid voice,
but this certainty of phrase was a resurrection. He
spoke without hesitation. Sure of himself. Sure
of the things he was about to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;You boys needn&#8217;t think that I don&#8217;t know what
I am talking about. I do. When I came back
from France there was something wrong. I was
afraid of everything. I lived for months in dread
of my shadow. It was awful. Nothing can be
worse. Then, one night I came to see that God&#8217;s
greatest gift to man is&mdash;strength to endure.&#8221;</p>

<p>He flung it at them&mdash;and their wide eyes answered
him. After a moment Arthur said, huskily,
&#8220;Gee, that&#8217;s great.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sandy sighed heavily. &#8220;I saw a picture the
other day of a boy who wanted to play baseball,
and he had to hold the baby. I reckon that&#8217;s what
you mean. Most of us have to hold the baby when
we want to play baseball.&#8221;</p>

<p>The others laughed, then young Arthur said, &#8220;It
looks to me as if life is just one darned thing after
another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not quite that.&#8221; Evans stood up. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
I&#8217;m an awful preacher,&#8221; he apologized, &#8220;but you
will ask questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most grown-ups don&#8217;t answer them,&#8221; said
Arthur, earnestly; &#8220;they just say, &#8216;Be good and let
who will be clever.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d better say &#8216;Be strong.&#8217;&#8221; Evans was
reeling in his line. &#8220;We must be getting towards
home. Do you see those shadows? We&#8217;ll be
late&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly. There had been the crack
of a twig and he had turned his eyes towards the
sound. And there, poised above him, her eyes
lighted up, her hands held out to him, her hat off,
the warm wind blowing her bobbed black hair,
blowing, too, the folds of the lilac frock back from
her slender figure, stood Jane ... <i>Jane</i>....</p>

<p>He went charging up the bank towards her.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was all. But he was there, holding her
hands, devouring her with his eyes.</p>

<p>Then he dropped her hands. &#8220;I thought you
were a ghost,&#8221; he said, a little awkwardly. &#8220;I
called you up this morning and Sophy said you
were in town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came out at noon. The day was so perfect.
I had to see the Glen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is perfect. When I found you were out, I
got the boys. I am taking a half-holiday after my
trip.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was talking naturally now, smiling up at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
as she stood above him. She found herself trembling,
almost afraid to speak again lest her voice
betray her. She had been more shaken than he by
the encounter. She wondered at his ease.</p>

<p>She was to wonder more, as he walked home with
her. The presence of the boys barred, of course,
personalities. But Evans&#8217; clear eyes met hers
without a shadow of self-consciousness. He asked
her about her journey, about Judy, about the
babies, about Bob. The only subject on which he
did not touch was her marriage with Frederick
Towne.</p>

<p>And so it happened that, woman-like, as they
walked alone at last after the boys had left them in
the little pine grove back of the house, that Jane
said, &#8220;Evans, you haven&#8217;t wished me happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, and his eyes met hers squarely.
&#8220;I think you might spare me that, Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>She flushed. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laid his hand for a moment on her shoulder.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be sorry, little Jane. But we won&#8217;t talk
about it. That&#8217;s the best way for both of us&mdash;not
to talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stayed to dinner, stayed for an hour or two
afterward&mdash;fitting himself in pleasantly to former
niches. Jane could hardly credit the change in
him. It was, she decided, not so much a resurrection
of the body as of the spirit. His hair was gray,
and now and then his eyes showed tired, his shoulders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
sagged. But there was no trace of the old
timidity, the old withdrawals. He was interested,
responsive, at times buoyant. The things she had
loved in him years ago were again there. <i>This
man did not think dark thoughts!</i></p>

<p>When he went away, she and Baldy stood together
on the terrace in the warm darkness and
watched him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He still limps a little,&#8221; Jane said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Shall we go in now, Jane?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Let&#8217;s sit on the steps and see the moon
rise.&#8221;</p>

<p>They sat side by side. &#8220;When is Towne coming
back?&#8221; Baldy asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;In three days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tree-toads were shrilling in monotonous cadence&mdash;from
far away came the plaintive note of a whippoorwill.
But there was another plaintive note
close at hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane, you&#8217;re crying,&#8221; Baldy said, sharply.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>He put his arm about her. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Baldy, I don&#8217;t want to get&mdash;married. I want
to stay with you&mdash;forever&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall stay with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sobbed and sobbed, and he soothed her.
&#8220;Little sister, little sister,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you are crying
too much in these days.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat up, wiped her eyes with his handkerchief,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
smoothed her hair with shaking hands. &#8220;It is
rather silly, Baldy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing of the kind, Janey. I knew the whole
thing was a mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped him with a touch of her hand on his
arm. &#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t a mistake, Baldy.
I was just a bit&mdash;low&mdash;in my mind&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I am going to let you marry
Towne?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a long silence. The bird in the Glen
said, &#8220;Whippoorwill&mdash;whippoorwill,&#8221; in dull reiteration,
the tree-toads shrilled, the rising moon
drew a line of gold across the horizon.</p>

<p>At last Jane spoke. &#8220;Dearest, I must marry
him. There&#8217;s no way out. He&#8217;s done so much for
me&mdash;and some day, perhaps, I&#8217;ll love him.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>HAUNTED</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was after the day when she had met Evans in
the Glen that Jane began to be haunted by ghosts.</p>

<p>There was a ghost who wandered through Sherwood
on moonlights, a limping, hesitating ghost
who said, &#8220;You&#8217;re wine, Jane. I must have my
daily sip of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>And there was a ghost who came in a fog and
said, &#8220;You are a lantern, Jane&mdash;held high.&#8221;</p>

<p>And that ghost in the glow of the hearth-fire&mdash;&#8220;You
are food and drink to me, Jane. Do you
know it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ghosts, ghosts, ghosts; holding out appealing
hands to her. And always she had turned away.
But now she did not turn. Over and over again
she lent her ears to those whispering words, &#8220;Jane,
you are wine.... Jane, you are a lantern....
You are food and drink, Jane....&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, she was having her punishment. She had
not loved him when he needed her. And now that
she needed him, she must not love him.</p>

<p>She hardly knew herself. All the years of her
life she had seen things straight, and she had tried
to live up to that vision. She saw them straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
now. She did not love Frederick Towne. She had
no right to marry him. Yet she must. There was
no way out.</p>

<p>Towne was aware of a difference in her when he
returned from New York. She was more remote.
A little less responsive. Yet these things caused
him no disquiet. Her crisp coolness had always
constituted one of her great charms. &#8220;You are
tired, dearest,&#8221; he told her. &#8220;I wish you would
marry me right away, and let me make you happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were lunching at the Capitol in the Senate
restaurant. Frederick was an imposing figure and
Jane was aware of his importance. People glanced
at him and glanced again, and then told others who
he was. Some day she would be his wife, and
everybody would be telling everybody else that she
was the wife of the great Frederick Towne.</p>

<p>The attentive waiter at her elbow laid toast on
her plate, and served Maryland crab from a silver
chafing-dish. Frederick knew what she liked and
had ordered without asking her. But the delicious
food was tasteless. She had been afraid Frederick
would say something about an immediate marriage,
and now he was saying it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she told him, earnestly, &#8220;you promised
I might wait until Judy could come on. In June.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know. But it will be very hot, and you&#8217;ll
have a whole lifetime in which to see Judy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But not at my wedding. She&#8217;s my only sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; but his voice showed his annoyance;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
&#8220;but it seems as if your family have demanded
enough of you. Can&#8217;t you think a bit about yourself&mdash;and
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>She pressed her point. &#8220;Judy is like my mother.
I can&#8217;t be married without her and the babies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the babies come, you&#8217;ll be looking after them
until the last moment, and it will be a great strain
on you, sweetheart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it won&#8217;t be. I adore babies.&#8221;</p>

<p>His quick jealousy flared. &#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; he said,
with a touch of sulkiness. &#8220;I&#8217;m not fond of children.&#8221;</p>

<p>She ate in silence. And presently he said repentantly,
&#8220;You must think me a great boor, Jane.
But you don&#8217;t know how much I want you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was like a repentant boy. She made herself
smile at him. &#8220;I think you are very patient, Mr.
Towne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not patient. I am most impatient. And
when are you going to stop calling me Mr. Towne?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I can call you&mdash;husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to wait until then, dearest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But &#8216;Frederick&#8217; is so long, and &#8216;Fred&#8217; is so
short, and &#8216;Ricky&#8217; sounds like a highball.&#8221; She
had thrown off her depression and was sparkling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody calls me &#8216;Ricky&#8217; but Adelaide. I always
hated it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you?&#8221; She was demure. &#8220;I might say
&#8216;my love,&#8217; like the ladies in the old-fashioned
novels.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>He laughed delightedly. &#8220;Say it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She acquiesced unexpectedly. &#8220;My love, we are
invited to a week-end with the Delafield Simms, at
their new country place, Grass Hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we?&#8221; Then in a sudden ardent rush of
words, &#8220;Jane, I&#8217;d kiss you if the world wasn&#8217;t looking
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The reporters would be ecstatic. Headlines.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am tired of headlines. And what do you
mean about going to Delafield Simms?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are asking a lot of his friends. It is his
wife&#8217;s introduction to his old crowd. Much will
depend on whether you and Edith will accept. And
it was Edith who asked me to&mdash;make you
come&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave him the truth, knowing it to be better
than diplomacy. &#8220;I told her that I couldn&#8217;t make
you. But perhaps if you knew I wanted it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
She paused inquiringly.</p>

<p>He leaned towards her across the table. &#8220;Ask
me, prettily, and I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; She laughed, blushed and did it.
&#8220;Will you go&mdash;my love?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could I say &#8216;no&#8217; to that?&#8221; He radiated satisfaction.
&#8220;Do you know how charming you are,
Jane?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I? But it is nice of you to go. I know
how you&#8217;ll hate it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if you are there. And now, who else are
asked?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, Mrs. Laramore and Eloise Harper and a lot
of others. Lucy says she&#8217;ll be like a fish out of
water, but Delafield has made up his mind that his
friends shan&#8217;t think that he&#8217;s ashamed of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>When their ices came and their coffee, Frederick
said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to spend a half-hour in a committee
room. Shall I take you up to the Senate Gallery?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;there&#8217;s nothing interesting, is there? I&#8217;ll
wait in Statuary Hall.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane loved the marble figures that circled the
Hall. Years ago there had not been so many. They
had been, then, perhaps, more distinctive. As a
child, she had chosen as her favorites the picturesque
Colonials, the frontiersmen in leather tunics
and coonskin caps. She had never liked the statesmen
in stiff shirts and frock coats, although she
had admitted their virtues. Even the incongruous
classic draperies were more in keeping with the
glamour which the past flung over the men who had
given their best to America.</p>

<p>But it was Fulton who had captured her imagination,
with his little ship, and Pere Marquette
with his cross, the peace-loving Quaker who had
conquered; adventurer, pioneer, priest and prophet&mdash;builders
all of the structure of the new world.</p>

<p>She wondered what future generations would
add to this glorious company. Would the Anglo-Saxon
give way to the Semite? Would the Huguenot
yield to the Slav? And would these newcomers
hold high the banner of national idealism? What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
would they give? And what would they take
away?</p>

<p>There were groups of sightseers gathered about
the great room&mdash;a guide placing them here and
there on the marble blocks. The trick was to put
someone behind a mottled pillar far away, and let
him speak. Owing to some strange acoustic quality
the sound would be telephoned to the person
who stood on the whispering stone.</p>

<p>Years ago Jane had listened while a voice had
come echoing across the hollow spaces of the great
Hall, &#8220;My country&mdash;right or wrong&mdash;my country&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Another ghost! The ghost of a boy, patriotic,
passionately devoted to the great old gods. &#8220;Of
course they were only men, Jane. Human. Faulty.
But they blazed a path of freedom for those who
followed....&#8221;</p>

<p>When Frederick came, he found her standing before
the prim statue of Frances Willard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tired, sweetheart?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I stayed longer than I expected.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It didn&#8217;t seem long. I have had plenty of company.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was puzzled. &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All these.&#8221; Her hand indicated the marble men
and women.</p>

<p>He laughed. &#8220;Great old freaks, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>Freaks!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>Gods!</p>

<p>Well, of course, it all depended absolutely on the
point of view.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like them all,&#8221; she said, sturdily, &#8220;even the
ones in the hideous frock coats.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely not, my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do. They may be bad art, but they&#8217;re
good Americans.&#8221;</p>

<p>His laugh was indulgent. &#8220;After you&#8217;ve been
abroad a few times, you won&#8217;t be so provincial.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If being provincial means loving my own, I&#8217;ll
stay provincial.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Travel broadens the mind, changes the point of
view.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why should I love my country less? I
know her faults. And I know Baldy&#8217;s. But I love
him just the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they walked on, he fell into step with her.
&#8220;We won&#8217;t argue. You are probably right, and if
not, you&#8217;re too pretty for me to contradict.&#8221;</p>

<p>His gallantry was faultless, but she wanted more
than gallantry. There had been the vivid give and
take of her arguments with Evans. They had had
royal battles, youth had crossed swords with youth.
And from their disagreements had come convictions.</p>

<p>She had once more the illusion of Frederick as a
feather cushion! He would perhaps agree with her
always!</p>

<p>And her soul would be&mdash;smothered!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br />

<small>AGAIN THE LANTERN</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the morning of the day that she was going
to the Delafield Simms, and Jane was packing her
bag. She felt unaccountably depressed. During
this week-end her engagement would be announced.
And when Judy came they would be married in the
Sherwood church.</p>

<p>And that would be the end of it!</p>

<p>Her lover had planned the honeymoon with enthusiasm,
&#8220;Dieppe, Jane, Avignon&mdash;the North Sea.
Such sunsets.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane felt that she didn&#8217;t care in the least for sunsets
or trips abroad. She was almost frightened at
her indifference to the wonders of a world of which
Frederick talked continually. Oh, what were
mountains and sea at a time like this? Her heart
should beat high&mdash;the dawns should be rosy, the
nights full of stars. But they were not. Her
heart was like a stone in her breast. The mornings
broke gray and blank. The nights were dark.
Her dreams were troubled.</p>

<p>She knew now what had happened to her. She
had let herself be blinded by a light which she had
thought was the sun. And it was not even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
moon! It was a big round artificial brilliance
which warmed no one!</p>

<p>Life with Frederick Towne would be just going
up and down great stairs, eating under the eye of a
stately butler, riding on puffy cushions behind a
stately chauffeur, sitting beside a man who was
everlastingly and punctiliously polite.</p>

<p>Oh, half the fun in the world was in the tussle
with hard things. She knew that now. Life in
the little house had been at times desperately difficult.
But it had been like facing a stiff breeze, and
coming out of it thrilled with the battle against the
elements.</p>

<p>Yet how could she tell these things to Frederick?
He was complacent, comfortable. She was young
and he liked that. He never dreamed that he might
seem to her somewhat staid and stodgy. For a moment,
in Chicago, he had been lighted by almost
youthful fires. But in these days of daily meetings,
she had become aware of his fixed habits, his fixed
opinions, the fixed programs which must be carried
out at any cost.</p>

<p>She had found, indeed, that she had little voice
in any plans that Frederick made for her. When
he consulted her on matters of redecorating the big
house he brought to the subject a wealth of technical
knowledge that appalled her. Jane knew
what she liked, but she did not know why she liked
it. But Frederick knew. He had the lore of period
furniture at his fingers&#8217; ends. Rugs and tapestries&mdash;paintings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
and porcelains! He had drawings
made and water-color sketches, and brought
them out to Jane. She had a feeling that when the
house was finished it would be like some exquisitely
ordered mausoleum. There would be no chintzes,
no pussy-cats purring, no Philomel singing!</p>

<p>As for clothes! Frederick&#8217;s mind dwelt much on
the subject. Jane was told that she must have an
ermine wrap, and one of Persian lamb. Most of
her things would be made in Paris&mdash;there was a
man over there who did things in just the right
style for her&mdash;picturesque but not sophisticated.
Frederick was already having certain jewels set
appropriately. Gray pearls and emeralds&mdash;he had
even gone to the point of getting samples of silk
and chiffon that she might see the smoke-gray and
jade color-scheme he had in mind for her.</p>

<p>Samples!</p>

<p>A man&#8217;s mind shouldn&#8217;t be on clothes. He
should have other things to think of.</p>

<p>There was Evans, for example. He had described
the other night the boys&#8217; club he was starting
in Sherwood. &#8220;In the old pavilion, Jane. It
will do as it is in summer, and in winter we&#8217;ll enclose
it. And we are to have a baseball team, and
play against the surrounding towns. You should
see my little lads.&#8221;</p>

<p>She and Baldy had been much interested. The
three of them had put their heads together as they
sat on the porch of the little house, with the moon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
whitening the world, and the whippoorwill mourning
far away in the swamp.</p>

<p>They had planned excitedly, and every word they
had said had been warm with enthusiasm. They
had been flushed, exultant. It would be a great
thing for Sherwood.</p>

<p>That was the kind of thing to live for, to live
with. Ideas. Effort. She had always known it.
Yet for a moment, she had forgotten. Had thought
of herself as&mdash;Curlylocks.</p>

<p>She flung up her hands in a sort of despair.
There was no way out of it. She was bound to
Frederick Towne by the favors she had accepted
from him. And that settled it.</p>

<p>She went on feverishly with the packing of her
shabby suitcase. She rather glorified in its shabbiness.
<i>At least it is mine own</i>, was her attitude of
mind.</p>

<p>As she leaned over it, the great ring that Frederick
had given her swung back and forth on its
ribbon. She tucked it into the neck of her frock
but it would not stay. At last she took it off and
was aware of a sense of freedom as if she had shed
her shackles. It winked and blinked at her on the
dresser, so she shut it in a drawer and was still
aware of it shining in the darkness, balefully!</p>

<p>Briggs was not to come for her until four in the
afternoon. She decided to go over to Castle Manor
and talk to Mrs. Follette. She would take some
strawberries as an excuse. The strawberries in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the Castle Manor garden were never as perfect as
those which Jane had planted. Evans said it was
because Jane coaxed things into rosiness and
roundness. But Jane had worked hard over the
beds, and she had had her reward.</p>

<p>Carrying a basket, therefore, of red and luscious
fruit, Jane went through the pine grove along the
path that led to the Castle Manor. Under the trees
was a green light which she breasted as one breasts
the cool waters of the sea. Her breath came
quickly. In a few short weeks she would be far
away from this sweet and silent spot, with its sacred
memories.</p>

<p>Leaving the grove, she passed the field where the
scarecrow reigned.</p>

<p>She leaned on the fence. With the coming of
spring, the scarecrow had been decked in gay attire.
He wore a pink shirt of Evans&#8217; and a pair of
white trousers. His hat was of straw, and as he
danced in the warm south breeze he had an air of
care-free jauntiness.</p>

<p>Jane found herself resenting his jaunty air. She
felt that she had liked him better in his days of appealing
loneliness. She had resented, in like manner,
the change in Evans. He, too, had an air of
making a world for himself. She had no part in it,
apparently. She was, in effect, the Peri at the
gate!</p>

<p>And she wanted to be in his world. Evans&#8217;
world. She didn&#8217;t want to be left out. Yet she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
had chosen. And Evans had accepted her decision.
She had not thought it would be so hard to have
him&mdash;accept.</p>

<p>His interests seemed now to include everything
but Jane. He was doing many things for the boys
of Sherwood, there was his work in town, the added
responsibility he had assumed in the affairs of the
farm.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s such an old darling, Jane. Doing it with
her duchess air. But she&#8217;s not strong. I&#8217;m trying
to make her let things go a bit. But she&#8217;s so proud
of her success. I wish you could see her showing
Edith Towne and her fashionable friends about the
dairy. With tea on the lawn afterward. You
must come over and join in the fun, Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am coming,&#8221; Jane had told him, &#8220;but my
days have been so filled.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had known who had filled them. But he had
ignored that, and had gone on with his subject.
&#8220;The idea I have now is to keep bees and sell honey.
The boys and I have some books on bee culture.
They are quite crazy about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was always now the boys and himself. His
mother and himself. And once it had been himself
and Jane!</p>

<p>Leaning on the fence, Jane spoke to the scarecrow.
&#8220;I ought to be glad but I am not.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scarecrow bowed and danced in the breeze.
He had no heart, of course. He was made of two
crossed sticks....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>Jane found Mrs. Follette on the wide porch. She
was snowy and crisp in white linen. She wore a
black enamel brooch, and a flat black hat which
was so old-fashioned that it took on a mid-Victorian
stateliness.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear child,&#8221; she said, &#8220;stay and have lunch
with me. Mary has baked fresh bread, and we&#8217;ll
have it with your berries, and some Dutch cheeses
and cream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d love it,&#8221; Jane said; &#8220;I hoped you&#8217;d ask me.
We are going at four to Delafield Simms for the
week-end. I shall have to be fashionable for forty-eight
hours, and I hate it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Follette smiled indulgently. &#8220;Of course,
you don&#8217;t mean it. And don&#8217;t try to be fashionable.
Just be yourself. It is only people who
have never been anybody who try to make themselves
like others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jane, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve never been
anybody, Mrs. Follette. I&#8217;m just little Jane
Barnes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her air was dejected.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you, Jane?&#8221; Mrs. Follette
demanded.</p>

<p>Jane clasped her hands together. &#8220;Oh, I want
my mother. I want my mother.&#8221; Her voice was
low, but there was a poignant note in it.</p>

<p>Old Mary came out with the tray, and when she
had gone, Mrs. Follette said, &#8220;Now tell me what&#8217;s
troubling you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of Mr. Towne&#8217;s big house, and&mdash;I think I&#8217;m
a little bit afraid of him, too, Mrs. Follette.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should you be afraid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of the things he&#8217;ll expect of me. The things I&#8217;ll
expect of myself. I can&#8217;t explain it. I just&mdash;feel it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Follette, pouring ice-cold milk from a silver
pitcher, said, &#8220;It is a case of nerves, my dear. You
don&#8217;t know how lucky you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I lucky?&#8221; wistfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you are lucky. But all girls feel as
you do, Jane, when the wedding day isn&#8217;t far off.
They wonder and wonder. It&#8217;s the newness&mdash;the&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Laying flesh and spirit ... in his
hands ...&#8217;&#8221; Jane quoted, with quick-drawn
breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t put it quite like that,&#8221; Mrs. Follette
said with some severity; &#8220;we didn&#8217;t talk like that
when I was a girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; Jane asked. &#8220;Well, I know you
were a darling, Mrs. Follette. And you were
pretty. There&#8217;s that portrait of you in the library
in pink.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I looked well in pink,&#8221; said Mrs. Follette,
thoughtfully, &#8220;but the best picture that was ever
done of me is a miniature that Evans has.&#8221; She
buttered another slice of bread. She had no fear
of growing fat. She <i>was</i> fat, but she was also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
stately and one neutralized the other. To think of
Mrs. Follette as thin would have been to rob her of
her duchess rle.</p>

<p>Jane had not seen the miniature. She asked if
she might.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get it,&#8221; said Mrs. Follette, and rose.</p>

<p>Jane protested, &#8220;Can&#8217;t I do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my dear. I know right where to put my
hand on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went into the cool and shadowy hall and
started up the stairs, and it was from the shadows
that Jane heard her call.</p>

<p>There was something faint and agitated in the
cry, and Jane flew on winged feet.</p>

<p>Mrs. Follette was holding on to the stair-rail,
swaying a little. &#8220;I can&#8217;t go any higher,&#8221; she
panted; &#8220;I&#8217;ll sit here, my dear, while you get my
medicine. It&#8217;s in my room on the dresser.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane passed her on the stairs, and was back
again in a moment with the medicine, a spoon, and
a glass of water. With her arm around the elder
woman she held her until the color returned to her
cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;How foolish,&#8221; said Mrs. Follette at last, sitting
up. &#8220;I almost fainted. I was afraid of falling
down the stairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me help you to your room,&#8221; Jane said,
&#8220;and you can lie on the couch&mdash;and be quiet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be quiet, but I&#8217;ll lie on the
couch&mdash;if you&#8217;ll sit there and talk to me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>So with Jane supporting her, Mrs. Follette went
up the rest of the flight, and across the hall&mdash;and
was made comfortable on a couch at the foot of her
bed.</p>

<p>Jane loved the up-stairs rooms at Castle Manor.
Especially in summer. Mrs. Follette followed the
southern fashion of taking up winter rugs and winter
curtains and substituting sheer muslins and
leaving a delightful bareness of waxed floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I can tell you where to find the miniature,&#8221;
Mrs. Follette said, as Jane fanned her; &#8220;it
is in Evans&#8217; desk set back under the row of pigeon-holes.
You can&#8217;t miss it, and I want to see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane crossed the hall to Evans&#8217; room. It faced
south and was big and square. It had the same
studied bareness that made the rest of the house
beautiful. There was a mahogany bed and dresser,
many books, deep window-seats with faded velvet
cushions.</p>

<p>Evans&#8217; desk was in an alcove by the east window
which overlooked Sherwood. It was a mahogany
desk of the secretary type, and there was nothing
about it to drain the color from Jane&#8217;s cheeks, to
send her hand to her heart.</p>

<p>Above the desk, however, where his eyes could
rest upon it whenever he raised them from his writing,
was an old lantern! Jane knew it at once. It
was an ancient ship&#8217;s lantern that she and Baldy
had used through all the years, a heritage from
some sea-going ancestor. It was the lantern she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
had carried that night she had found Evans in the
fog!</p>

<p>Since her return from Chicago she had not been
able to find it. Baldy had complained, &#8220;Sophy
must have taken it home with her.&#8221; But Sophy
had not taken it. It was here. And Jane knew,
with a certainty that swept away all doubts, why.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You are a lantern, Jane, held high....</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>She found the miniature and carried it back to
Mrs. Follette. &#8220;I told you you were pretty and
you have never gotten over it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had regained her radiance. Mrs. Follette
reflected complacently that girls were like that.
Moods of the moment. Even in her own day.</p>

<p>She spoke of it to Evans that night. &#8220;Jane had
lunch with me. She was very tired and depressed.
I told her not to worry. It&#8217;s natural she should
feel the responsibility of the future. Marriage is a
serious obligation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marriage is more than that, Mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s a great adventure. The greatest adventure.
If a woman loved me, I&#8217;d want her to fly
to me&mdash;on wings. There&#8217;d be no fear of the future
if Jane loved Towne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she does love him. She wouldn&#8217;t marry
him for his money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, she wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; with a touch of weariness.
&#8220;It is one of the things I can&#8217;t make clear to myself.
And I think I&#8217;d rather not talk about it, Mother.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>They were in Mrs. Follette&#8217;s room. She had told
her son about her heart attack, and he had been
anxious. But she had been quite herself after and
had made light of it. &#8220;I shall have Hallam over
in the morning,&#8221; he had insisted, and she had acquiesced.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t need him, but if it will make
you feel better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Evans told her &#8220;good-night&#8221; presently and went
into his own room. It was flooded with moonlight.
He curled up on the cushions of the window-seat,
with his arms around his knees and thought of
Jane. He did not know that she had been that day
in his room. Yet she was there now&mdash;a shadowy
presence. The one woman in the world for him.
The woman who had lighted his way. Who still,
thank God, lighted it, though she was not his and
would never be.</p>

<p>In a few short weeks she would be married.
Would go out of his life&mdash;forever. Yet what she
had been to him, Towne could never take away.
The little Jane of Sherwood whom Evans had
known would never belong absolutely to her husband.
Her spirit would escape him&mdash;come back
where it belonged, to the man who worshipped her.</p>

<p>He stood up, struck a match and lighted the low
candle in the old lantern. It would burn dimly
until he was asleep. Night after night he had
opened his eyes to see it burning. It seemed to him
that his dreams were less troubled because of that
dim lantern.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<small>THE DISCORDANT NOTE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span> was still to Eloise Harper the stenographer
of Frederick Towne. Out of place, of course, in
this fine country house, with its formal gardens, its
great stables, its retinue of servants.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you do with yourselves?&#8221; she asked
her hostess, as she came down, ready for dinner, in
revealing apricot draperies and found Lucy crisp
in white organdie with a band of black velvet
around her throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do?&#8221; Lucy&#8217;s smile was ingenuous. &#8220;We are
very busy, Del and I. We feed the pigs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pigs?&#8221; Eloise stared. She had assumed that
a girl of Lucy&#8217;s type would affect an elaborate attitude
of leisure. And here she was, instead, fashionably
energetic.</p>

<p>They fed the pigs, it seemed, actually. &#8220;Of
course not the big ones. But the little ones have
their bottles. There are ten and their mother died.
You should see Del and me. He carries the bottle
in a metal holder&mdash;round,&#8221;&mdash;Lucy&#8217;s hand described
the shape,&mdash;&#8220;and when they see him coming they
all squeal, and it&#8217;s adorable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucy&#8217;s air was demure. She was very happy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
She was a woman of strong spirit. Already she
had interested her weak husband beyond anything
he had ever known in his drifting days of bachelorhood.
&#8220;After dinner,&#8221; she told Eloise, &#8220;I&#8217;ll show
you Del&#8217;s roses. They are quite marvellous. I
think his collection will be beyond anything in this
part of the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delafield, coming up, said, &#8220;They are Lucy&#8217;s
roses, but she says I am to do the work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why not have a gardener?&#8221; Eloise demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we have. But I should hate to have our
garden a mere matter of&mdash;mechanics. Del has
some splendid ideas. We are going to work for the
flower shows. Prizes and all that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delafield purred like a pussy-cat. &#8220;I shall name
my first rose the &#8216;Little Lucy Logan.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Edith, locking arms with Jane, a little later, as
they strolled under a wisteria-hung trellis towards
the fountain, said, &#8220;Lucy&#8217;s making a man of him
because she loves him. And I would have laughed
at him. We would have bored each other to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They will never be bored,&#8221; Jane decided, &#8220;with
their roses and their little pigs.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had reached the fountain. It was an old-fashioned
one, with thin streams of water spouting
up from the bill of a bronzed crane. There were
goldfish in the pool, and a big green frog leaped
from a lily pad. Beyond the fountain the wisteria
roofed a path of pale light. A peacock walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
slowly towards them, its long tail sweeping the
ground in burnished beauty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think of this,&#8221; said Jane, &#8220;and Lucy&#8217;s days at
the office.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; Edith pondered, &#8220;she told me if he
had not had a penny she would have been happy
with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe it. With a cottage, one pig, and a
rose-bush, they would find bliss. It is like that
with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two women sat down on the marble coping of
the fountain. The peacock trailed by them, its
jewels all ablaze under the sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;That peacock makes me think of Adelaide.&#8221;
Edith swept her hand through the water, scaring
the little fishes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that dress she had on to-night&mdash;bronze and
blue and green tulle. I will say this for Adelaide,
she knows how to dress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does she ever think of anything else but
clothes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Men,&#8221; succinctly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Women like Adelaide,&#8221; Edith elucidated,
&#8220;want to look well, and to be admired. They live
for it. They wake up in the morning and go to bed
with that one idea. And the men fall for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Adelaide knows how to play on the keys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
of their vanity. You and I don&#8217;t&mdash;or won&#8217;t. When
our youth goes, Jane, we&#8217;ll have to be loved for our
virtues. Adelaide will be loved for the part she
plays, and she plays it well.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed and stood up. &#8220;I am afraid your
announcement to-morrow will hurt her feelings,
Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She knows,&#8221; Jane said quietly. &#8220;Mr. Towne
told her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; Edith stopped, and went on in a
lower tone, &#8220;Speaking of angels&mdash;here she comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adelaide, in her burnished tulle, tall, slender,
graceful as a willow, was swinging along beneath
the trellis. The peacock had turned and walked
beside her. &#8220;What a picture Baldy could make of
that,&#8221; Edith said, &#8220;&#8216;The Proud Lady.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; Jane&#8217;s voice was also lowered,
&#8220;when I look at her, I feel that it is she who should
marry your uncle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edith was frank. &#8220;I should hate her. And so
would he in a month. She&#8217;s artificial, and you are
so adorably natural, Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adelaide had reached the circle of light that surrounded
the fountain. &#8220;The men have come and
have gone up to dress,&#8221; she said. &#8220;All except your
uncle, Edith. He telephoned that he can&#8217;t get here
until after dinner. He has an important conference.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said he might be late. Benny came, of
course?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, and Eloise is happy. He had brought her
all the town gossip. That&#8217;s why I left. I hate
gossip.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edith knew that pose. No one could talk more
devastatingly than Adelaide of her neighbor&#8217;s affairs.
But she did it, subtly, with an effect of
charity. &#8220;I am very fond of her,&#8221; was her way of
prefacing a ruthless revelation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought your brother would be down,&#8221; Adelaide
looked at Jane, poised on the rim of the fountain,
like a blue butterfly,&mdash;&#8220;but he wasn&#8217;t with
the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Baldy can&#8217;t be here until to-morrow noon. He
had to be in the office.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with yourself in the
meantime, Edith?&#8221; Adelaide was in a mood to
make people uncomfortable. She was uncomfortable
herself. Jane, in billowing heavenly blue with
rose ribbons floating at her girdle, was youth incarnate.
And it was her youth that had attracted
Towne.</p>

<p>The three women walked towards the house together.
As they came out from under the arbor,
they were aware of black clouds stretched across
the horizon. &#8220;I hope it won&#8217;t rain,&#8221; Edith said.
&#8220;Lucy is planning to serve dinner on the terrace.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adelaide was irritable. &#8220;I wish she wouldn&#8217;t.
There&#8217;ll be bugs and things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane liked the idea of an out-of-door dinner. She
thought that the maids in their pink linen were like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
rose-leaves blown across the lawn. There was a
great umbrella over the table, rose-striped. &#8220;How
gay it is,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I hope the rain won&#8217;t spoil it.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they reached the wide-pillared piazza, no
one was there. The wind was blowing steadily
from the bank of clouds. Edith went in to get a
scarf.</p>

<p>And so Jane and Adelaide were left alone.</p>

<p>Adelaide sat in a big chair with a back like a
spreading fan; she was statuesque, and knew it,
but she would have exchanged at the moment every
classic line for the effect that Jane gave of unpremeditated
grace and beauty. The child had flung
a cushion on the marble step, and had dropped
down upon it. The wind caught up her ruffles, so
that she seemed to float in a cloud.</p>

<p>She laughed, and tucked her whirling draperies
about her. &#8220;I love the wind, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Adelaide did not love the wind. It rumpled her
hair. She felt spitefully ready to hurt Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a pity,&#8221; she said, after a pause, &#8220;that
Ricky can&#8217;t dine with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane agreed. &#8220;Mr. Towne always seems to be a
very busy person.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adelaide carried a little gauze fan with gold-lacquered
sticks. When she spoke she kept her
eyes upon the fan. &#8220;Do you always call him &#8216;Mr.
Towne&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But not when you&#8217;re alone.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>Jane flushed. &#8220;Yes, I do. Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear, it is so very formal. And you
are going to marry him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said that he had told you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ricky tells me everything. We are very old
friends, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane said nothing. There was, indeed, nothing
to say. She was not in the least jealous of Adelaide.
She wondered, of course, why Towne should
have overlooked this lovely lady to choose a shabby
child. But he had chosen the child, and that settled
it as far as Mrs. Laramore was concerned.</p>

<p>But it did not settle it for Adelaide. &#8220;I think it
is distinctly amusing for you to call him &#8216;Mr.
Towne.&#8217; Poor Ricky! You mustn&#8217;t hold him at
arms&#8217; length.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, none of the rest of us have,&#8221; said Adelaide,
deliberately.</p>

<p>Jane looked up at her. &#8220;The rest of you?
What do you mean, Mrs. Laramore?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the women that Ricky has loved,&#8221; lightly.</p>

<p>The winds fluttered the ribbons of Jane&#8217;s frock,
fluttered her ruffles. The peacock on the lawn uttered
a discordant note. Jane was subconsciously
aware of a kinship between Adelaide and the burnished
bird. She spoke of the peacock.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a disagreeable voice he has.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adelaide stared. &#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The peacock,&#8221; said Jane.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>Then Eloise and Edith came in, and presently
the men, and Lucy and Del from a trip to the small
porkers, and Adelaide going out with Del to dinner
was uncomfortably aware that Jane had either artlessly
or artfully refused to discuss with her the
women who had been loved by Frederick Towne!</p>

<p>The dinner was delicious. &#8220;Our farm products,&#8221;
Delafield boasted. Even the fish, it seemed, he had
caught that morning, motoring over to the river
and bringing them back to be split and broiled and
served with little new potatoes. There was chicken
and asparagus, small cream cheeses with the salad,
heaped-up berries in a Royal Worcester bowl,
roses from the garden. &#8220;All home-grown,&#8221; said
the proud new husband.</p>

<p>Jane ate with little appetite. She had refused to
discuss with Adelaide the former heart affairs of
her betrothed, but the words rang in her ears, &#8220;The
women that Ricky has loved.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane was young. And to youth, love is for the
eternities. The thought of herself as one of a succession
of Dulcineas was degrading. She was
restless and unhappy. It was useless to assure
herself that Towne had chosen her above all the
rest. She was not sophisticated enough to assume
that it is, perhaps, better to be a man&#8217;s last love
than his first. That Towne had made it possible
for any woman to speak of him as Adelaide spoke,
seemed to Jane to drag her own relation to him in
the dust.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>The strength of the wind increased. The table
was sheltered by the house, but at last Delafield
decided, &#8220;We&#8217;d better go in. The rain is coming.
We can have our coffee in the hall.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their leaving had the effect of a stampede. Big
drops splashed into the plates. The men servants
and maids scurried to the rescue of china and linen.</p>

<p>The draperies of the women streamed in the
wind. Adelaide&#8217;s tulle was a banner of green and
blue. The peacock came swiftly up the walk, crying
raucously, and found a sheltered spot beneath
the steps.</p>

<p>From the wide hall, they saw the rain in silver
sheets. Then the doors were shut against the beating
wind.</p>

<p>They drank their coffee, and bridge tables were
brought in. There were enough without Jane to
form two tables. And she was glad. She wandered
into the living-room and curled herself up in
a window-seat. The window opened on the porch.
Beyond the white pillars she could see the road,
and the rain-drenched garden.</p>

<p>After a time the rain stopped, and the world
showed clear as crystal against the opal brightness
of the western sky. The peacock came out of his
hiding-place, and dragged a heavy tail over the sodden
lawn.</p>

<p>It was cool and the air was sweet. Jane lay
with her head against a cushion, looking out. She
was lonely and wished that Towne would come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
Perhaps in his presence her doubts would vanish.
It grew dark and darker. Jane shut her eyes and
at last she fell asleep.</p>

<p>She was waked by Towne&#8217;s voice. He was on the
porch. &#8220;Where is everybody?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Adelaide who answered him. &#8220;They have
motored into Alexandria to the movies. Eloise
would have it. But I stayed&mdash;waiting for you,
Ricky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Jane?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She went up-stairs early. Like a sleepy child.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane heard his laugh. &#8220;She is a child&mdash;a darling
child.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then in the darkness Adelaide said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t,
Ricky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember that once upon a time you
called me&mdash;a darling child?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I? Well, perhaps you were. You are certainly
a very charming woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane, listening breathlessly, assured herself that
of course he was polite. He had to be.</p>

<p>Adelaide was speaking. &#8220;So you are going to
announce it to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who told you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Edith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it seemed best, Adelaide. The wedding
day isn&#8217;t far off&mdash;and the world will have to know
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>A hushed moment, then, &#8220;Oh, Ricky, Ricky!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>&#8220;Adelaide! Don&#8217;t take it like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help it. You are going out of my life.
And you&#8217;ve always been so strong, and big, and
brave. No other man will ever match you.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he spoke, his voice had a new and softer
note. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t dream it would hurt you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have known.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lightning flickering along the horizon showed
Adelaide standing beside Towne&#8217;s chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ricky&#8221;&mdash;the whispered words reached Jane&mdash;&#8220;kiss
me once&mdash;to say &#8216;good-bye.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<small>FLIGHT</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Young</span> Baldwin Barnes, on Saturday morning,
ate breakfast alone in the little house. He read his
paper and drank his coffee. But the savor of
things was gone. He missed Jane. Her engaging
chatter, the spirited challenge, even the small irritations.
&#8220;She is such a darling-dear,&#8221; was his
homesick meditation.</p>

<p>Oh, a man needed a woman on the other side of
the table. And when Jane was married, what then?</p>

<p><i>Edith!</i></p>

<p>Oh, if he might! If Philomel might sing for
her! Toast and poached eggs! Nectar and ambrosia!
His little house a castle!</p>

<p>&#8220;But it isn&#8217;t mine own,&#8221; the young poet reminded
himself; &#8220;there is still the mortgage.&#8221; He
came down to earth, cleared the table, fed the pussy-cats.
Then he went down to the post-box to get the
mail.</p>

<p>The Barnes&#8217; mail was rarely voluminous, rarely
interesting. A bill or two, a letter from Judy&mdash;some
futile advertising stuff.</p>

<p>This morning, however, there was a long envelope.
In one corner was the name of the magazine
to which, nearly six months before, Baldy had sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
his prize cover design. The thing had almost gone
out of his thoughts. He had long ceased to hope.
Money did not miraculously fall into one&#8217;s lap.</p>

<p>He tore open the envelope. Within was a closely
typed letter and a pale pink check.</p>

<p>The check was for two thousand dollars. He
had won the prize!</p>

<p>Breathless with the thought of it, deprived of
strength, he sat down on the terrace steps. Merrymaid
and the kitten came down and angled for
attention, but Baldy overlooked them utterly. The
letter was astounding. The magazine had not only
given him the prize but they wanted more of his
work. They would pay well for it&mdash;and if he would
come to New York at their expense, the art editor
would like to talk it over!</p>

<p>Baldy, looking up from the pregnant phrases and
catching Merrymaid&#8217;s eye upon him, demanded,
&#8220;Now, what do you think of that? Shall I resign
from the office? I&#8217;ll tell the world, I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oh, the thing might even make it possible for
him to marry Edith. He could at least pay for the
honeymoon&mdash;preserve some sense of personal independence
while he worked towards fame. If she
would only see it. That he must ask her to live
for a time&mdash;in the little house. He&#8217;d make things
easy for her,&mdash;oh, well, the thing could be done&mdash;it
could be done.</p>

<p>He flew up the steps on the wings of his delight.
He would ride like the wind to Virginia&mdash;find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
Edith, in a rose-garden, fling himself at her feet!
Declare his good fortune! And he would see her
eyes!</p>

<p>Packing his bag, he decided to stop in Washington,
and perpetrate a few extravagances. Something
for Edith. Something for Jane. Something
for himself. There would be no harm in looking his
best....</p>

<p>He arrived at Grass Hills in time for lunch. His
little Ford came up the drive as proudly as a Rolls-Royce.
And Baldy descending was a gay and gallant
figure. There was no one in sight but the
servants who took his bag, and drove his car
around to the garage. A maid in rose linen said
that Mr. and Mrs. Simms were at the stables. Miss
Towne was on the links with the other guests, and
would return from the Country Club in time for
lunch at two o&#8217;clock. Miss Barnes was up-stairs.
Her head had ached, and she had had her breakfast
in bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you let her know that I am here?&#8221;</p>

<p>The maid went up and came down again to say
that Miss Barnes was in the second gallery&mdash;and
would he go right up.</p>

<p>The second gallery looked out over the river.
Jane lay in a long chair. She was pale, and there
were shadows under her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, look here, Janey,&#8221; Baldy blurted out, &#8220;is
it as bad as this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just&mdash;lazy.&#8221; She sat up and kissed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
him. Then buried her face in his coat and wept
silently.</p>

<p>&#8220;For heaven&#8217;s sake, Jane,&#8221; he patted her shoulder,
&#8220;what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to go home.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked blank. &#8220;Home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; She stopped crying. &#8220;Baldy, something
has happened&mdash;and I&#8217;ve got to tell you.&#8221; Tensely,
with her hands clasped about her knees, she rehearsed
for him the scene between Adelaide and
Frederick Towne. And when she finished she said,
&#8220;I can&#8217;t marry him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not. A girl like you. You&#8217;d be miserable.
And that&#8217;s the end of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Utterly miserable.&#8221; She stared before her.
Then presently she went on. &#8220;I stayed up-stairs
all the morning. Lucy and Edith have been perfect
dears. I think Edith lays it to the announcement
of my engagement to-night. That I was
dreading it. Of course it mustn&#8217;t be announced,
Baldy.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood up, sternly renouncing his dreams.
&#8220;Get your things on, Jane, and I&#8217;ll take you home.
You can&#8217;t stay here, of course. We can decide
later what it is best to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how I can break it off. He&#8217;s done
so much for us. I can&#8217;t ever&mdash;pay him&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>In Baldy&#8217;s pocket was the pink slip. He took it
out and handed it to his sister. &#8220;Jane, I got the
prize. Two thousand dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>&#8220;Baldy!&#8221; Her tone was incredulous.</p>

<p>He had no joy in the announcement. The thing
had ceased to mean freedom&mdash;it had ceased to mean&mdash;Edith.
It meant only one thing at the moment, to
free Jane from bondage.</p>

<p>He gave Jane the letter and she read it. &#8220;It is
your great opportunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; He refused to discuss that aspect of it.
&#8220;And it comes in the nick of time for you, old
dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their flight was a hurried one. A note for Lucy
and one for Towne. A note for Edith!</p>

<p>Jane was not well was the reason given their
hostess. The note to Towne said more than that.
And the note to Edith was&mdash;renunciation.</p>

<p>Edith coming home to luncheon found the note
in her room. All the morning she had been filled
with glorious anticipation. Baldy would arrive in
a few hours. Together they would walk down that
trellised path to the fountain, they would sit on the
marble coping. She would trail her hand through
the water. Further than that she would not let
her imagination carry her. It was enough that she
would see him in that magic place with his air of
golden youth.</p>

<p>But she was not to see him, for the note said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Beloved&mdash;I make no excuse for calling you that
because I say it always in my heart&mdash;Jane has made
up her mind that she cannot marry your uncle. So
we are leaving at once.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you what the thought of these two
days with you meant to me. And now I must give
them up. Perhaps I must give you up, I don&#8217;t
know. I came with high hopes. I go away without
any hope at all. But I love you.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Edith read the note twice, then put it to her lips.
She hardly dared admit to herself the keenness of
her disappointment.</p>

<p>She stood for a long time at the window looking
out. Why had Jane decided not to marry Uncle
Frederick? What had happened since yesterday
afternoon?</p>

<p>From Edith&#8217;s window she could see the south
lawn. The servants were arranging a buffet
luncheon. Little tables were set around&mdash;and
wicker chairs. Adelaide, tall and fair, in her favorite
blue and a broad black hat stood by one of
the little tables. She was feeding the peacock with
bits of bread. She made a picture, and Towne&#8217;s
window faced that way.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Edith said, and stopped. She
remembered coming in from the movies the night
before and finding Adelaide and Towne on the
porch. And where was Jane?</p>

<p>Towne did not eat lunch. He pleaded important
business, and had his car brought around. But
everybody knew that he was following Jane.
Mystery was in the air. Adelaide was restless.
Only Edith knew the truth.</p>

<p>After lunch, she told Lucy. &#8220;Jane isn&#8217;t going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
to marry Uncle Fred. I don&#8217;t know why. But I
am afraid it is breaking up your house party.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope it is,&#8221; said Lucy, calmly. &#8220;Delafield is
bored to death. He wants to get back to his pigs
and roses. I am speaking frankly to you because
I know you understand. I want our lives to be
bigger and broader than they would have been if
we hadn&#8217;t met. And as for you&#8221;&mdash;her voice shook
a little&mdash;&#8220;you&#8217;ll always be a sort of goddess blessing
our hearth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edith bent and kissed her, emotion gripping her.
&#8220;Your hearth is blessed without me,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;but I&#8217;ll always be glad to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Towne, riding like mad along the Virginia roads,
behind the competent Briggs, reread Jane&#8217;s letter.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I was not up-stairs last night when you came.
I was asleep in the window-seat of the living-room,
just off the porch. And your voice waked me and
I heard what you said, and Mrs. Laramore. And
I can&#8217;t marry you. I know how much you&#8217;ve done
for me,&mdash;and I shall never forget your goodness.
Baldy will take me home.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Enclosed was a pink check.</p>

<p>Towne blamed Adelaide furiously. Of course it
was her fault. Such foolishness. And sentimentality.
And he had been weak enough to fall for it.</p>

<p>Yet, as he cooled a bit, he was glad that Jane
had showed her resentment. It was in keeping with
his conception of her. Her innocence had flamed
against such sophistication. There might, too, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
a hint of jealousy. Women were like that. Jealous.</p>

<p>As they whirled through Washington, Briggs
voiced his fears. &#8220;If we meet a cop it will be all
up with us, Mr. Towne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take a chance, Briggs. Give her more gas.
We&#8217;ve got to get there.&#8221;</p>

<p>With all their speed, however, it was four o&#8217;clock
when they reached Sherwood. Towne was still in
the clothes he had worn on the links. He had not
eaten since breakfast. He felt the strain.</p>

<p>He stormed up the terrace, where once he had
climbed in the snow. He rang the bell. It whirred
and whirred again in the silence. The house was
empty.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<small>IN THE PINE GROVE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was on the way home that Jane had said to
Baldy: &#8220;I feel like a selfish pig.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, my dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To take your precious prize before it is cold.
It doesn&#8217;t seem right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t a question of right or wrong. If things
turn out with these new people as I hope, I&#8217;ll be
painting like mad for the next two months. And
you&#8217;ll have your work cut out for you as my model.
They like you, Jane. They said so.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had driven on steadily for a time, and had
then said, &#8220;I never wanted you to marry him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not, Baldy?&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned his lighted-up eyes upon her. &#8220;Janey&mdash;I
wanted you to have your&mdash;dreams&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She had laid her hand on his arm in a swift
caress. &#8220;You&#8217;re a darling&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and after a while,
&#8220;Nothing can take us from each other, ever,
Baldy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Never had they drawn closer in spirit than at
this moment. But they said very little about it.
When they came to the house, Baldy went at once
to the garage. &#8220;I&#8217;ll answer that letter, and put in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
a good afternoon looking over my sketches.&#8221; He
did not tell her how gray the day stretched ahead
of him&mdash;that golden day which had started with
high hopes.</p>

<p>Jane changed to a loose straight frock of orange
cotton, and without a hat, feeling actual physical
freedom in the breaking of her bonds, she swung
along the path to the little grove. It was aromatic
with the warm scent of the pines, and there was a
cool shade in the heart of it. Jane had brought a
bag of stockings to mend, and sat down to her
homely task, smiling a little as she thought of the
contrast between this afternoon and yesterday,
when she had sat on the rim of the fountain and
watched Adelaide and the peacock. She had no
feeling of rancor against Adelaide. She was aware
only of a great thankfulness.</p>

<p>She was, indeed, at the moment, steeped in divine
content. Here was the place where she belonged.
She had a sense of blissful escape.</p>

<p>Merrymaid came down the path, her tail a plume.
The kitten followed. A bronze butterfly floated
across their vision, and they leaped for it&mdash;but it
went above them&mdash;joyously towards the open blue
of the sky. The two cats gazed after it, then composed
themselves carefully like a pair of miniature
lions&mdash;their paws in front of them, sleepy-eyed but
alert for more butterflies, or for Jane&#8217;s busy thread.</p>

<p>And it was thus that Towne found her. Convinced
that the house was empty, he had started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
towards Baldy&#8217;s studio. Then down the vista of
the pine grove, his eye had been caught by a spot
of golden color. He had followed it.</p>

<p>She laid down her work and looked up at him.
&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t have come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear child, why not? Jane, you are making
mountains of molehills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down beside her. The little cats drew
away, doubtful. &#8220;It was natural that you should
have resented it. And a thing like that isn&#8217;t easy
for a man to explain. Without seeming a&mdash;cad&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t anything to explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there is. I have made you unhappy, and
I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head, and spoke thoughtfully. &#8220;I
think I am&mdash;happy. Mr. Towne, your world isn&#8217;t
my world. I like simple things and pleasant
things, and honest things. And I like a One-Woman
man, Mr. Towne.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tried to laugh. &#8220;You are jealous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, quietly, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t that, although
men like you think it is. A woman who has self-respect
must know her husband has her respect.
Her heart must rest in him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke slowly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll admit that I&#8217;ve philandered
a lot. But I&#8217;ve never wanted to marry anyone
but you. I can promise you my future.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. But even if last night had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
been&mdash;I think I should have&mdash;given you up. I had
begun to feel that I didn&#8217;t love you. That out there
in Chicago you swept me off my feet. Mr. Towne,
I am sorry. And I am grateful. For all your kindness&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
She flushed and went on, &#8220;You know,
of course, that I shan&#8217;t be happy until&mdash;I don&#8217;t
owe you anything....&#8221;</p>

<p>He laid his hand on hers. &#8220;I wish you wouldn&#8217;t
speak of it. It was nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a great deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked down at her, slender and young and
infinitely desirable. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t think I am going
to let you go,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid&mdash;you must&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He flamed suddenly. &#8220;I&#8217;m more of a One-Woman
man than you think. If you won&#8217;t marry
me, I won&#8217;t have anyone else. I&#8217;ll go on alone. As
for Adelaide&mdash;&mdash;A woman like that doesn&#8217;t expect
much more than I gave. That&#8217;s all I can say about
her. She means nothing to me, seriously, and never
will. She plays the game, and so do I, but it&#8217;s only
a game.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked tired and old. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go abroad to-morrow.
When I come back, perhaps you&#8217;ll
change your mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall never change it,&#8221; she said, &#8220;never.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood up. &#8220;Jane, I could make you happy.&#8221;
He held her hand as she stood beside him.</p>

<p>She looked at him and knew that he could not.
Her dreams had come back to her&mdash;of Galahad&mdash;of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
Robin Hood ... the world of romance had
again flung wide its gates....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After Towne had gone she sat for a long time
thinking it over. She blamed herself. She had
broken her promise. Yet, he, too, had broken a
promise.</p>

<p>She finished mending the stockings, and rolled
them into compact balls. The little cats were
asleep&mdash;the shadows were stretched out and the
sun slanted through the pines. She had dinner to
get, for her return had been unexpected, and Sophy
had not been notified.</p>

<p>She might have brought to the thought of her
tasks some faint feeling of regret. But she had
none. She was glad to go in&mdash;to make an omelette&mdash;and
cream the potatoes&mdash;and have hot biscuits
and berries&mdash;and honey.</p>

<p>Planning thus, competently, she raised her eyes&mdash;to
see coming along the path the two boys who
had of late been Evans&#8217; close companions. She
spoke to them as they reached her. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you
stay a minute? I&#8217;ll make you some lemonade.&#8221;</p>

<p>They stopped and looked at her in a way that
startled her. &#8220;We can&#8217;t,&#8221; Arthur said; &#8220;we&#8217;re going
over to the Follettes. We thought we might
help.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stared at them. &#8220;Help? What do you
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sandy gasped. &#8220;Oh, didn&#8217;t you know? Mrs.
Follette died this morning....&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX<br />

<small>JANE DREAMS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Evans</span> had found his mother at noon, lying on
the couch at the foot of her bed. He had stayed at
home in the morning to help her, and at ten o&#8217;clock
she had gone up-stairs to rest a bit before lunch.
Old Mary had called her, and she had not answered.
So Evans had entered her room to find
that she had slipped away peacefully from the
world in which she exaggerated her own importance.
It would go on without her. She had not
been neighborly but the neighbors would all come
and sympathize with her son. And they would
miss her, because she had added to the community
some measure of stateliness, which they admired
even as they resented it.</p>

<p>Evans had tried to get Baldy on the telephone,
but could not. Jane was at Grass Hills. He would
call up at long distance later. There was no reason
why he should spoil for them this day of days.</p>

<p>So he had done the things that had to be done
in the shadowed house. Dr. Hallam came, and
others. Evans saw them and they went away. He
moved in a dream. He had no one to share intimately
his sorrow&mdash;no sister, no brother, no one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
except his little dog, who trailed after him, wistful-eyed,
and with limping steps.</p>

<p>The full force of the thing that had happened
did not come to him at once. He had a feeling that
at any moment his mother might sweep in from the
out-of-doors, in her white linen and flat black hat,
and sit at the head of the table, and tell him the
news of the morning.</p>

<p>He had had no lunch, so old Mary fixed a tray
for him. He did not eat, but drank some milk.
Then he and Rusty took up their restless wandering
through the silent rooms. Old Mary, true to
tradition, had drawn all the blinds and shut many
of the windows, so that the house was filled with a
sort of golden gloom. Evans went into his mother&#8217;s
little office on the first floor, and sat down at
her desk. It was in perfect order, and laid out on
the blotter was the writing paper with the golden
crest, and the box of golden seals. And he had
laughed at her! He remembered with a pang that
they would never again laugh together. He was
alone.</p>

<p>He wondered why such things happened. Was
all of life as sinister as this? Must one always
find tragedy at every turn of the road? He had lost
his youth, had lost Jane. And now his mother.
Was everything to be taken away? Would there
be nothing left but strength to endure?</p>

<p>Well, God helping him, he would endure to the
end....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>He closed the desk gently and went out into the
darkened hall. As he followed its length, a door
opened at the end. Black against the brightness
beyond, he saw the two lads. They came forward
with some hesitation, but when they saw his tired
face, they forgot self-consciousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;We just heard. And we want to help.&#8221; Sandy
was spokesman. Arthur was speechless. But he
caught hold of Evans&#8217; sleeve and looked up at him.
His eyes said what his voice refused.</p>

<p>Evans, with his arms across their shoulders, drew
the boys to him. &#8220;It was good of you to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Barnes said,&#8221; again it was Sandy who
spoke, &#8220;that perhaps we might get some pine from
the little grove. That your mother liked it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Barnes? Is she back? Does she know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We told her. She is coming right over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baldy drove Jane in his little car. As she entered
she seemed to bring the light in with her.
She illumined the house like a torch.</p>

<p>She walked swiftly towards Evans, and held out
her hand. &#8220;My dear, I am so sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were at Grass Hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We came back unexpectedly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so glad&mdash;you came.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was having a bad time with his voice. He
could not go on....</p>

<p>Jane spoke to the boys. &#8220;Did you ask him about
the pine branches? Just those, and roses from the
garden, Evans.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>&#8220;You always think of things&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Baldy will take the boys to the grove, and do
any errands you may have for him.&#8221; She was her
calm and competent self&mdash;letting him get control
of his emotion while she directed others.</p>

<p>Baldy, coming in, wrung Evans&#8217; hand. &#8220;The
boys and I will get the pine, and Edith Towne is
coming out to help. I called her up to tell
her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Baldy stopped at that. He could not speak here
of the glory that encompassed him. He had said,
&#8220;<i>If death should come to us, Edith! Does anything
else count?</i>&#8221; And she had said, &#8220;<i>Nothing.</i>&#8221;
And now she was coming and they would pick roses
together in the garden. And love and life would
minister to a greater mystery....</p>

<p>When Baldy and the boys had gone, Jane and
Evans opened the windows and pulled up the
shades. The house was filled with clear light, and
was cool in the breeze.</p>

<p>When they had finished, Jane said, &#8220;That&#8217;s all,
I think. We can rest a bit. And presently it will
be time for dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want any dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were in the library. Outside was an
amethyst twilight, with a young moon low in
the sky. Evans and Jane stood by the window,
looking out, and Jane asked in a hushed voice,
&#8220;You don&#8217;t want any dinner because she won&#8217;t be
at the other end of the table?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; His face was turned from her. His
hands were clinched. His throat was dry. For a
moment he wished he were alone that he might
weep for his mother.</p>

<p>And then Jane said, &#8220;Let me sit at the other end
of your table.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned back to her, and saw her eyes, and
what he saw made him reach out blindly for her
hand&mdash;sympathy, tenderness&mdash;a womanly brooding
tenderness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Evans, Evans,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I am not going
to marry Frederick Towne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; thickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t love him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you love me, Jane?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded and could not speak. They clung together.
He wept and was not ashamed of it.</p>

<p>And standing there, with his head against her
breast, Jane knew that she had found the best.
Marriage was not a thing of luxury and soft living,
of flaming moments of wild emotion. It was a
thing of hardness shared, of spirit meeting spirit,
of dream matching dream. Jane, that afternoon,
had caught her breath as she had come into the
darkened hall, and had seen Evans standing between
those slender lads. So some day, perhaps, in
this old house&mdash;his sons!</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online

  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
